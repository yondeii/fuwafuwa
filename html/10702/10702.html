<h3><b>まえがき</b></h3>
<p>倉持 三郎</p>
<p>本書はイギリスの小説家、D. H. ロレンスの中編小説The Foxの対訳本です。現在では、翻訳本の入手がなかなか難しい小説です。そこで、広くみなさんに読んでいただこうという趣旨のもと、電子書籍の形でつくりました。</p>
<p>電子書籍の対訳本で使いやすい点は、英語の原文から読み進めても、日本語の訳から読み進めても、気になるところ、分からないところがあれば、それぞれの言語ですぐに確認できるリンク形式の対訳になっているところです。日本語で内容を理解してから英語で読んでも構いません。言語学習の一環として対訳を上手に使ってください。</p>
<p>また、登場人物やその関係を知るために、各セクションの扉にQuestionを入れました。Answerはわたし自身の解答です。試験問題と違い、正解というものはありせん。こういうQ&amp;Aを考える過程で作品の読みが深まることを期待しています。<br /></p>
<p>この作品はイギリス南部の田園を背景にしたものです。日本でいう田園風景と、イギリスの田園風景は異なります。また、1918年前後のイギリス社会が舞台となっているため、第一次世界大戦下やイギリスの階級制度の知識が必要となります。</p>
<p>そういった風土や時代背景を知るために、「解説」を編集担当の金矢真美さんにつけてもらいました。語句の説明だけでなく、作品に現われるイギリス独特の風物や事物が、写真つきで解説されています。みなさんがイギリスを旅行しても都市部が中心になり、田園までは見る余裕がないかもしれません。「解説」を読んでいただければ、イギリスの田園について基本的な知識が得られると思います。</p>
<p>小説を読むうえでいちばん大切なのは、人間の思想、感情の理解です。この作品では、男女関係が扱われています。男女関係ということになれば、イギリス人と日本人の間に本質的な違いはありません。そこに生まれる感情を理解することは、わたしたちが人間を理解する上でかならず役立ってくれると思います。<br /></p>

<h3><b>Scene 1</b></h3>
<p>第一次世界大戦が終わろうとしている頃、ふたりの女性、バンフォードとマーチは、バンフォードの父親が提供した資金で、農園の経営を始めます。家事を受け持つ、ひ弱なバンフォードと、力仕事を一手に引き受けるたくましいマーチ。慣れない農園経営に一喜一憂しては、将来に不安を抱えた生活を続けていました。そんなある日、いつもニワトリを襲っていくキツネが、マーチの眼の前に現れました。</p>

<div id="calibre_link-701">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-88">1-A</a><br /></p>
<p><a href="#calibre_link-46">The two girls</a>&nbsp;were usually known by their surnames, Banford and March.<a href="#calibre_link-47">&nbsp;They had taken the farm together, intending to work it all by themselves: that is, they were going to rear chickens, make a living by poultry, and add to this by keeping a cow, and raising one or two young beasts.&nbsp;</a>Unfortunately, things did not turn out well.</p>
<p>Banford was a small, thin, delicate thing with spectacles. She, however, was the principal investor, &nbsp;for March had little or no money.&nbsp;Banford's father, who was a tradesman in&nbsp;<a href="#calibre_link-48">Islington</a>, gave his daughter the start, for her health's sake, and because he loved her, and because it did not look as if she would marry. March was more robust. She had learned carpentry and joinery at the evening classes in&nbsp;Islington. She would be the man about the place. They had, moreover, Banford's old grandfather living with them at the start. He had been a farmer. But unfortunately the old man died after he had been at Bailey Farm for a year. Then the two girls were left alone.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-555">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-310">1-B</a><br /></p>
<p>They were neither of them young: that is, they were near thirty. But they certainly were not old. They set out quite gallantly with their enterprise.&nbsp;<a href="#calibre_link-276">They had numbers of chickens, black Leghorns and white Leghorns, Plymouths and Wyandottes;</a>&nbsp;also some ducks; also two heifers in the fields. One heifer, unfortunately, refused absolutely to stay in the Bailey Farm closes.&nbsp;<a href="#calibre_link-277">No matter how March made up the fences, the heifer was out, wild in the woods, or trespassing on the neighbouring pasture</a>, and March and Banford were away, flying after her, with more haste than success. So this heifer they sold in despair. Then, just before the other beast was expecting her first calf, the old man died, and the girls, afraid of the coming event, sold her in a panic, and limited their attentions to fowls and ducks.</p>
<p>In spite of a little chagrin, it was a relief to have no more cattle on hand. Life was not made merely to be slaved away. Both girls agreed in this. The fowls were quite enough trouble.&nbsp;<a href="#calibre_link-257">March had set up her carpenter's bench at the end of the open shed.</a>&nbsp;Here she worked, making coops and doors and other appurtenances.&nbsp;<a href="#calibre_link-257">The fowls were housed in the bigger building, which had served as barn and cowshed in old days.</a>&nbsp;They had a beautiful home, and should have been perfectly content. Indeed, they looked well enough. But the girls were disgusted at their tendency to strange illnesses, at their exacting way of life, and at their refusal, obstinate refusal to lay eggs.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-719">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-580">1-C</a><br /></p>
<p>March did most of the outdoor work. When she was out and about,<a href="#calibre_link-126"> in her puttees and breeches, her belted coat and her loose cap,</a>&nbsp;she looked almost like some graceful, loose-balanced young man, for her shoulders were straight, and her movements easy and confident, even tinged with a little indifference or irony. But her face was not a man's face, ever. The wisps of her crisp dark hair blew about her as she stooped, her eyes were big and wide and dark, when she looked up again, strange, startled, shy and sardonic at once. Her mouth, too, was almost pinched as if in pain and irony. There was something odd and unexplained about her. She would stand balanced on one hip, looking at the fowls pattering about in the obnoxious fine mud of the sloping yard, and calling to her favourite white hen, which came in answer to her name. But there was an almost satirical flicker in March's big, dark eyes as she looked at her three-toed flock pottering about under her gaze, and the same slight dangerous satire in her voice as she spoke to the favoured Patty, who pecked at March's boot by way of friendly demonstration.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-55">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-24">1-D</a><br /></p>
<p>Fowls did not flourish at Bailey Farm, in spite of all that March did for them. When she provided hot food for them in the morning, according to rule, she noticed that it made them heavy and dozy for hours. She expected to see them lean against the pillars of the shed in their languid processes of digestion. And she knew quite well that they ought to be busily scratching and foraging about, if they were to come to any good. So she decided to give them their hot food at night, and let them sleep on it. Which she did. But it made no difference.</p>
<p>War conditions, again, were very unfavourable to poultry keeping. Food was scarce and bad.&nbsp;<a href="#calibre_link-56">And when the Daylight Saving Bill was passed, the fowls obstinately refused to go to bed as usual, about nine o'clock in the summer time.</a>&nbsp;That was late enough, indeed, for there was no peace till they were shut up and asleep. Now they cheerfully walked around, without so much as glancing at the barn, until ten o'clock or later. Both Banford and March disbelieved in living for work alone. They wanted to read or take a cycle-ride in the evening,&nbsp;<a href="#calibre_link-57">or perhaps&nbsp;March wished to paint curvilinear swans on porcelain, with green background, or else make a marvellous fire-screen by processes of elaborate cabinet work.&nbsp;</a>For she was a creature of odd whims and unsatisfied tendencies. But from all these things she was prevented by the stupid fowls.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-406">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-256">1-E</a><br /></p>
<p>One evil there was greater than any other.&nbsp;<a href="#calibre_link-168">Bailey Farm was a little homestead, with ancient wooden barn and low-gabled farm-house</a>, lying just one field removed from the edge of the wood. Since the war the fox was a demon. He carried off the hens under the very noses of March and Banford. Banford would start and stare through her big spectacles with all her eyes, as another squawk and flutter took place at her heels. Too late! Another white Leghorn gone. It was disheartening.</p>
<p>They did what they could to remedy it. When it became permitted to shoot foxes, they stood sentinel with their guns, the two of them, at the favoured hours. But it was no good. The fox was too quick for them. So another year passed, and another, and they were living on their losses, as Banford said. They let their farm-house one summer, and retired to live in a railway-carriage that was deposited as a sort of out-house in a corner of the field. This amused them, and helped their finances. None the less, things looked dark.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-633">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-507">1-F</a><br /></p>
<p>Although they were usually the best of friends, because Banford, though nervous and delicate, was a warm, generous soul, and March, though so odd and absent in herself, had a strange magnanimity, yet, in the long solitude, they were apt to become a little irritable with one another, tired of one another. March had four-fifths of the work to do, and though she did not mind, there seemed no relief, and it made her eyes flash curiously sometimes. Then Banford, feeling more nerve-worn than ever, would become despondent, and March would speak sharply to her. They seemed to be losing ground, somehow, losing hope as the months went by.&nbsp;<a href="#calibre_link-374">There alone in the fields by the wood, with the wide country stretching hollow and dim to the round hills of the White Horse, in the far distance, they seemed to have to live too much off themselves.</a>&nbsp;There was nothing to keep them up --- and no hope.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-363">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-364">1-G</a><br /></p>
<p>The fox really exasperated them both. As soon as they had let the fowls out, in the early summer mornings, they had to take their guns and keep guard: and then again, as soon as evening began to mellow, they must go once more. And he was so sly. He slid along in the deep grass; he was difficult as a serpent to see. And he seemed to circumvent the girls deliberately. Once or twice March had caught sight of the white tip of his brush, or the ruddy shadow of him in the deep grass, and she had let fire at him. But he made no account of this.</p>
<p>One evening March was standing with her back to the sunset, her gun under her arm, her hair pushed under her cap. She was half watching, half musing. It was her constant state. Her eyes were keen and observant, but her inner mind took no notice of what she saw. She was always lapsing into this odd, rapt state, her mouth rather screwed up. It was a question whether she was there, actually conscious present, or not.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-34">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-35">1-H</a><br /></p>
<p>The trees on the wood-edge were a darkish, brownish green in the full light --- for it was the end of August. Beyond, the naked, copper-like shafts and limbs of the pine-trees shone in the air. Nearer the rough grass, with its long, brownish stalks all agleam, was full of light. The fowls were round about --- the ducks were still swimming on the pond under the pine-trees. March looked at it all, saw it all, and did not see it. She heard Banford speaking to the fowls in the distance --- and she did not hear. What was she thinking about? Heaven knows. Her consciousness was, as it were, held back.</p>
<p>She lowered her eyes, and suddenly saw the fox. He was looking up at her. Her chin was pressed down, and his eyes were looking up. They met her eyes. And he knew her. She was spell-bound --- she knew he knew her. So he looked into her eyes, and her soul failed her. He knew her, he was not daunted.</p>
<p>She struggled, confusedly she came to herself, and saw him making off, with slow leaps over some fallen boughs, slow, impudent jumps. Then he glanced over his shoulder, and ran smoothly away. She saw his brush held smooth like a feather, she saw his white buttocks twinkle. And he was gone, softly, soft as the wind.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-253">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-254">1-I</a><br /></p>
<p>She put her gun to her shoulder, but even then pursed her mouth, knowing it was nonsense to pretend to fire. So she began to walk slowly after him, in the direction he had gone, slowly, pertinaciously. She expected to find him. In her heart she was determined to find him. What she would do when she saw him again she did not consider. But she was determined to find him. So she walked abstractedly about on the edge of the wood, with wide, vivid dark eyes, and a faint flush in her cheeks. She did not think. In strange mindlessness she walked hither and thither.</p>
<p>At last she became aware that Banford was calling her. She made an effort of attention, turned, and gave some sort of screaming call in answer. Then again she was striding off towards the homestead. The red sun was setting, the fowls were retiring towards their roost. She watched them, white creatures, black creatures, gathering to the barn. She watched them spell-bound, without seeing them. But her automatic intelligence told her when it was time to shut the door.</p>
<p>She went indoors to supper, which Banford had set on the table. Banford chatted easily. March seemed to listen, in her distant, manly way. She answered a brief word now and then. But all the time she was as if spell-bound. And as soon as supper was over, she rose again to go out, without saying why.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-594">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-595">1-J</a><br /></p>
<p>She took her gun again and went to look for the fox. For he had lifted his eyes upon her, and his knowing look seemed to have entered her brain. She did not so much think of him: she was possessed by him. She saw his dark, shrewd, unabashed eye looking into her, knowing her. She felt him invisibly master her spirit. She knew the way he lowered his chin as he looked up, she knew his muzzle, the golden brown, and the greyish white. And again, she saw him glance over his shoulder at her, half inviting, half contemptuous and cunning. So she went, with her great startled eyes glowing, her gun under her arm, along the wood edge. Meanwhile the night fell, and a great moon rose above the pine-trees. And again Banford was calling.</p>
<p>So she went indoors. She was silent and busy. She examined her gun, and cleaned it, musing abstractedly by the lamp-light. Then she went out again, under the great moon, to see if everything was right. When she saw the dark crests of the pine-trees against the blood-red sky, again her heart beat to the fox, the fox. She wanted to follow him, with her gun.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-197">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-198">1-K</a><br /></p>
<p>It was some days before she mentioned the affair to Banford. Then suddenly one evening she said:</p>
<p>"The fox was right at my feet on Saturday night."</p>
<p>"Where?" said Banford, her eyes opening behind her spectacles.</p>
<p>"When I stood just above the pond."</p>
<p>"Did you fire?" cried Banford.</p>
<p>"No, I didn't."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"Why, I was too much surprised, I suppose."</p>
<p>It was the same old, slow, laconic way of speech March always had. Banford stared at her friend for a few moments.</p>
<p>"You saw him?" she cried.</p>
<p>"Oh yes! He was looking up at me, cool as anything."</p>
<p>"I tell you," cried Banford --- "the cheek! They're not afraid of us, Nellie."</p>
<p>"Oh, no," said March.</p>
<p>"Pity you didn't get a shot at him," said Banford.</p>
<p>"Isn't it a pity! I've been looking for him ever since. But I don't suppose he'll come so near again."</p>
<p>"I don't suppose he will," said Banford.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-402">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-403">1-L</a><br /></p>
<p>And she proceeded to forget about it, except that she was more indignant than ever at the impudence of the beggar. March also was not conscious that she thought of the fox. But whenever she fell into her half-musing, when she was half rapt and half intelligently aware of what passed under her vision, then it was the fox which somehow dominated her unconsciousness, possessed the blank half of her musing. And so it was for weeks, and months. No matter whether she had been climbing the trees for the apples, or beating down the last of the damsons, or whether she had been digging out the ditch from the duck-pond, or clearing out the barn, when she had finished, or when she straightened herself, and pushed the wisps of hair away again from her forehead, and pursed up her mouth again in an odd, screwed fashion, much too old for her years, there was sure to come over her mind the old spell of the fox, as it came when he was looking at her. It was as if she could smell him at these times. And it always recurred, at unexpected moments, just as she was going to sleep at night, or just as she was pouring the water into the tea-pot to make tea --- it was the fox, it came over her like a spell.</p>
<p>So the months passed. She still looked for him unconsciously when she went towards the wood. He had become a settled effect in her spirit, a state permanently established, not continuous, but always recurring. She did not know what she felt or thought: only the state came over her, as when he looked at her.</p>

<div>マーチはヘンリーのどんな外見から彼がキツネに似ていると思ったのでしょうか。（2-D）<br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<p></p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-616">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-617">2-A</a><br /></p>
<p>The months passed, the dark evenings came, heavy, dark November, when March went about in high boots, ankle deep in mud, when the night began to fall at four o'clock, and the day never properly dawned. Both girls dreaded these times. They dreaded the almost continuous darkness that enveloped them on their desolate little farm near the wood. Banford was physically afraid. She was afraid of tramps, afraid lest someone should come prowling round. March was not so much afraid as uncomfortable, and disturbed. She felt discomfort and gloom in all her physique.</p>
<p>Usually the two girls had tea in the sitting room. March lighted a fire at dusk, and put on the wood she had chopped and sawed during the day. Then the long evening was in front, dark, sodden, black outside, lonely and rather oppressive inside, a little dismal. March was content not to talk, but Banford could not keep still. Merely listening to the wind in the pines outside, or the drip of water, was too much for her.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-133">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-134">2-B</a><br /></p>
<p>One evening the girls had washed up the tea-things in the kitchen, and March had put on her house-shoes, and taken up a roll of crochet-work, which she worked at slowly from time to time. So she lapsed into silence. Banford stared at the red fire, which, being of wood, needed constant attention. She was afraid to begin to read too early, because her eyes would not bear any strain. So she sat staring at the fire, listening to the distant sounds, sound of cattle lowing, of a dull, heavy moist wind, of the rattle of the evening train on the little railway not far off. She was almost fascinated by the red glow of the fire.</p>
<p>Suddenly both girls started, and lifted their heads. They heard a footstep --- distinctly a footstep. Banford recoiled in fear. March stood listening. Then rapidly she approached the door that led into the kitchen. At the same time they heard the footsteps approach the back door. They waited a second. The back door opened softly. Banford gave a loud cry. A man's voice said softly:</p>
<p>"Hello!"</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-443">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-444">2-C</a><br /></p>
<p>March recoiled, and took a gun from a corner.</p>
<p>"What do you want?" she cried, in a sharp voice.</p>
<p>Again the soft, softly-vibrating man's voice said:</p>
<p>"Hello! What's wrong!"</p>
<p>"I shall shoot!" cried March. "What do you want?"</p>
<p>"Why, What's wrong? What's wrong?" came the soft, wondering, rather scared voice: and a young soldier, with his heavy kit on his back, advanced into the dim light.</p>
<p>"Why," he said, "who lives here then?"</p>
<p>"We live here," said March. "What do you want?"</p>
<p>"Oh!" came the long, melodious, wonder-note from the young soldier. "Doesn't William Grenfel live here then?"</p>
<p>"No --- you know he doesn't."</p>
<p>"Do I? Do I? I don't, you see. He did live here, because he was my grandfather, and I lived here myself five years ago. What's become of him then?"</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-530">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-531">2-D</a><br /></p>
<p>The young man --- or youth, for he would not be more than twenty --- now advanced and stood in the inner doorway. March, already under the influence of his strange, soft, modulated voice, stared at him spell-bound. He had a ruddy, roundish face, with fairish hair, rather long, flattened to his forehead with sweat. His eyes were blue, and very bright and sharp. On his cheeks, on the fresh ruddy skin were fine, fair hairs, like a down, but sharper. It gave him a slightly glistening look. Having his heavy sack on his shoulders, he stooped, thrusting his head forward. His hat was loose in one hand. He stared brightly, very keenly from girl to girl, particularly at March, who stood pale, with great dilated eyes, in her belted coat and puttees, her hair knotted in a big crisp knot behind. She still had the gun in her hand. Behind her, Banford, clinging to the sofa-arm, was shrinking away, with half-averted head.</p>
<p>"I thought my grandfather still lived here? I wonder if he's dead."</p>
<p>"We've been here for three years," said Banford, who was beginning to recover her wits, seeing something boyish in the round head with its rather long, sweaty hair.</p>
<p>"Three years! You don't say so! And you don't know who was here before you?"</p>
<p>"I know it was an old man, who lived by himself."</p>
<p>"Ay! Yes, that's him! And what became of him then?"</p>
<p>"He died. I know he died."</p>
<p>"Ay! He's dead then!"</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-700">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-142">2-E</a><br /></p>
<p>The youth stared at them without changing colour or expression. If he had any expression, besides a slight baffled look of wonder, it was one of sharp curiosity concerning the two girls; sharp, impersonal curiosity, the curiosity of that round young head.</p>
<p>But to March he was the fox. Whether it was the thrusting forward of his head, or the glisten of fine whitish hairs on the ruddy cheek-bones, or the bright, keen eyes, that can never be said: but the boy was to her the fox, and she could not see him otherwise.</p>
<p>"How is it you didn't know if your grandfather was alive or dead?" asked Banford, recovering her natural sharpness.</p>
<p>"Ay, that's it," replied the softly-breathing youth. "You see, I joined up in Canada, and I hadn't heard for three or four years. I ran away to Canada."</p>
<p><a href="#calibre_link-689">"And now have you just come from France?"</a><br /></p>
<p><a href="#calibre_link-689">"Well --- from Salonika really."</a><br /></p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-661">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-358">2-F</a><br /></p>
<p>There was a pause, nobody knowing quite what to say.</p>
<p>"So you've nowhere to go now?" said Banford rather lamely.</p>
<p>"Oh, I know some people in the village.&nbsp;<a href="#calibre_link-74">Anyhow, I can go to the Swan.</a>"</p>
<p>"You came on the train, I suppose. Would you like to sit down a bit?"</p>
<p>"Well --- I don't mind."</p>
<p>He gave an odd little groan as he swung off his kit. Banford looked at March.</p>
<p>"Put the gun down," she said. "We'll make a cup of tea."</p>
<p>"Ay," said the youth. "We've seen enough of rifles."</p>
<p>He sat down rather tired on the sofa, leaning forward.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-221">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-222">2-G</a><br /></p>
<p>March recovered her presence of mind, and went into the kitchen. There she heard the soft young voice musing:</p>
<p>"Well, to think I should come back and find it like this!" He did not seem sad, not at all --- only rather interestedly surprised.</p>
<p>"And what a difference in the place, eh?" he continued, looking round the room.</p>
<p>"You see a difference, do you?" said Banford.</p>
<p>"Yes --- don't I!"</p>
<p>His eyes were unnaturally clear and bright, though it was the brightness of abundant health.</p>
<p>March was busy in the kitchen preparing another meal. It was about seven o'clock. All the time, while she was active, she was attending to the youth in the sitting-room, not so much listening to what he said as feeling the soft run of his voice. She primmed up her mouth tighter and tighter, puckering it as if it were sewed, in her effort to keep her will uppermost. Yet her large eyes dilated and glowed in spite of her; she lost herself. Rapidly and carelessly she prepared the meal, cutting large chunks of bread and margarine --- for there was no butter. She racked her brain to think of something else to put on the tray --- she had only bread, margarine, and jam, and the larder was bare. Unable to conjure anything up, she went into the sitting-room with her tray.</p>
<p>She did not want to be noticed. Above all, she did not want him to look at her. But when she came in, and was busy setting the table just behind him, he pulled himself up from his sprawling, and turned and looked over his shoulder. She became pale and wan.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-611">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-612">2-H</a><br /></p>
<p>The youth watched her as she bent over the table, looked at her slim, well-shapen legs, at the belted coat dropping around her thighs, at the knot of dark hair, and his curiosity, vivid and widely alert, was again arrested by her.</p>
<p>The lamp was shaded with a dark-green shade, so that the light was thrown downwards and the upper half of the room was dim. His face moved bright under the light, but March loomed shadowy in the distance.</p>
<p>She turned round, but kept her eyes sideways, dropping and lifting her dark lashes. Her mouth unpuckered as she said to Banford:</p>
<p>"Will you pour out?"</p>
<p>Then she went into the kitchen again.</p>
<p>"Have your tea where you are, will you?" said Banford to the youth --- "unless you'd rather come to the table."</p>
<p>"Well," said he, "I'm nice and comfortable here, aren't I? I will have it here, if you don't mind."</p>
<p>"There's nothing but bread and jam," she said. And she put his plate on a stool by him. She was very happy now, waiting on him. For she loved company. And now she was no more afraid of him than if he were her own younger brother. He was such a boy.</p>
<p>"Nellie," she called. "I've poured you a cup out."</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-42">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-43">2-I</a><br /></p>
<p>March appeared in the doorway, took her cup, and sat down in a corner, as far from the light as possible. She was very sensitive in her knees. Having no skirts to cover them, and being forced to sit with them boldly exposed, she suffered. She shrank and shrank, trying not to be seen. And the youth, sprawling low on the couch, glanced up at her, with long steady, penetrating looks, till she was almost ready to disappear. Yet she held her cup balanced, she drank her tea, screwed up her mouth and held her head averted. Her desire to be invisible was so strong that it quite baffled the youth. He felt he could not see her distinctly. She seemed like a shadow within the shadow. And ever his eyes came back to her, searching, unremitting, with unconscious fixed attention.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he was talking softly and smoothly to Banford, who loved nothing so much as gossip, and who was full of perky interest, like a bird. Also he ate largely and quickly and voraciously, so that March had to cut more chunks of bread and margarine, for the roughness of which Banford apologised.</p>
<p>"Oh, well," said March, suddenly speaking, "if there's no butter to put on it, it's no good trying to make dainty pieces."</p>
<p>Again the youth watched her, and he laughed, with a sudden, quick laugh, showing his teeth and wrinkling his nose.</p>
<p>"It isn't, is it," he answered, in his soft, near voice.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-271">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-272">2-J</a><br /></p>
<p><a href="#calibre_link-273">It appeared he was Cornish by birth and upbringing.&nbsp;When he was twelve years old he had come to Bailey Farm with his grandfather, with whom he had never agreed very well. So he had run away to Canada, and worked far away in the West. Now he was here --- and that was the end of it.</a><br /></p>
<p>He was very curious about the girls, to find out exactly what they were doing. His questions were those of a farm youth; acute, practical, a little mocking. He was very much amused by their attitude to their losses: for they were amusing on the score of heifers and fowls.</p>
<p>"Oh, well," broke in March, "we don't believe in living for nothing but work."</p>
<p>"Don't you?" he answered. And again the quick young laugh came over his face. He kept his eyes steadily on the obscure woman in the corner.</p>
<p>"But what will you do when you've used up all your capital?" he said.</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't know," answered March laconically. "Hire ourselves out for land-workers, I suppose."</p>
<p>"Yes, but there won't be any demand for women land-workers now the war's over," said the youth.</p>
<p>"Oh, we'll see. We shall hold on a bit longer yet," said March, with a plangent, half-sad, half-ironical indifference.</p>
<p>"There wants a man about the place," said the youth softly.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-723">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-724">2-K</a><br /></p>
<p>Banford burst out laughing.</p>
<p>"Take care what you say," she interrupted. "We consider ourselves quite efficient."</p>
<p>"Oh," came March's slow plangent voice, "it isn't a case of efficiency, I'm afraid. If you're going to do farming you must be at it from morning till night, and you might as well be a beast yourself."</p>
<p>"Yes, that's it's it," said the youth. "You aren't willing to put yourselves into it."</p>
<p>"We aren't," said March, "and we know it."</p>
<p>"We want some of our time for ourselves," said Banford.</p>
<p>The youth threw himself back on the sofa, his face tight with laughter, and laughed silently but thoroughly. The calm scorn of the girls tickled him tremendously.</p>
<p>"Yes," he said, "but why did you begin then?"</p>
<p>"Oh," said March, "we had a better opinion of the nature of fowls then than we have now."</p>
<p>"Of Nature altogether, I'm afraid," said Banford. "Don't talk to me about Nature."</p>
<p>Again the face of the youth tightened with delighted laughter.</p>
<p>"You haven't a very high opinion of fowls and cattle, have you?" he said.</p>
<p>"Oh no --- quite a low one," said March.</p>
<p>He laughed out.</p>
<p>"Neither fowls nor heifers," said Banford, "nor goats nor the weather."</p>
<p>The youth broke into a sharp yap of laughter, delighted. The girls began to laugh too, March turning aside her face and wrinkling her mouth in amusement.</p>
<p>"Oh, well," said Banford, "we don't mind, do we, Nellie?"</p>
<p>"No," said March, "we don't mind."</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-317">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-318">2-L</a><br /></p>
<p>The youth was very pleased. He had eaten and drunk his fill. Banford began to question him. His name was Henry Grenfel --- no, he was not called Harry, always Henry. He continued to answer with courteous simplicity, grave and charming. March, who was not included, cast long, slow glances at him from her recess, as he sat there on the sofa, his hands clasping his knees, his face under the lamp bright and alert, turned to Banford. She became almost peaceful at last. He was identified with the fox --- and he was here in full presence. She need not go after him any more. There in the shadow of her corner she gave herself up to a warm, relaxed peace, almost like sleep, accepting the spell that was on her. But she wished to remain hidden. She was only fully at peace whilst he forgot her, talking to Banford. Hidden in the shadow of the corner, she need not any more be divided in herself, trying to keep up two planes of consciousness. She could at last lapse into the odour of the fox.</p>
<p>For the youth, sitting before the fire in his uniform, sent a faint but distinct odour into the room, indefinable, but something like a wild creature. March no longer tried to reserve herself from it. She was still and soft in her corner like a passive creature in its cave.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-634">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-635">2-M</a><br /></p>
<p>At last the talk dwindled. The youth relaxed his clasp of his knees, pulled himself together a little, and looked round. Again he became aware of the silent, half-invisible woman in the corner.</p>
<p>"Well," he said unwillingly, "I suppose I'd better be going, or they'll be in bed at the Swan."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid they're in bed, anyhow," said Banford. "They've all got this influenza."</p>
<p>"Have they!" he exclaimed. And he pondered. "Well," he continued, "I shall find a place somewhere."</p>
<p>"I'd say you could stay here, only --- " Banford began.</p>
<p>He turned and watched her, holding his head forward.</p>
<p>"What?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, well," she said, "propriety, I suppose." She was rather confused.</p>
<p>"It wouldn't be improper, would it?" he said, gently surprised.</p>
<p>"Not as far as we're concerned," said Banford.</p>
<p>"And not as far as I'm concerned," he said, with grave naiveté. "After all, it's my own home, in a way."</p>
<p>Banford smiled at this.</p>
<p>"It's what the village will have to say," she said.</p>

<p>マーチの夢は何を表しているのでしょうか。（3-A）</p>

</div>
<div id="calibre_link-603">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-604">3-A</a><br /></p>
<p>March disappeared to attend the room. Banford was as pleased and thoughtful as if she had her own young brother home from France. It gave her just the same kind of gratification to attend on him, to get out the bath for him, and everything. Her natural warmth and kindliness had now an outlet. And the youth luxuriated in her sisterly attention. But it puzzled him slightly to know that March was silently working for him too. She was so curiously silent and obliterated. It seemed to him he had not really seen her. He felt he should not know her if he met her in the road.</p>
<p>That night March dreamed vividly. She dreamed she heard a singing outside which she could not understand, a singing that roamed round the house, in the fields, and in the darkness. It moved her so that she felt she must weep. She went out, and suddenly she knew it was the fox singing. He was very yellow and bright, like corn. She went nearer to him, but he ran away and ceased singing. He seemed near, and she wanted to touch him. She stretched out her hand, but suddenly he bit her wrist, and at the same instant, as she drew back, the fox, turning round to bound away, whisked his brush across her face, and it seemed his brush was on fire, for it seared and burned her mouth with a great pain. She awoke with the pain of it, and lay trembling as if she were really seared.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-17">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-18">3-B</a><br /></p>
<p>In the morning, however, she only remembered it as a distant memory. She arose and was busy preparing the house and attending to the fowls. Banford flew into the village on her bicycle to try and buy food. She was a hospitable soul. But alas in the year 1918 there was not much food to buy. The youth came downstairs in his shirt-sleeves. He was young and fresh, but he walked with his head thrust forward, so that his shoulders seemed raised and rounded, as if he had a slight curvature of the spine. It must have been only a manner of bearing himself, for he was young and vigorous. He washed himself and went outside, whilst the women were preparing breakfast.</p>
<p>He saw everything, and examined everything. His curiosity was quick and insatiable. He compared the state of things with that which he remembered before, and cast over in his mind the effect of the changes. He watched the fowls and the ducks, to see their condition; he noticed the flight of wood-pigeons overhead: they were very numerous; he saw the few apples high up, which March had not been able to reach;<a href="#calibre_link-19">&nbsp;he remarked that they had borrowed a draw-pump, presumably to empty&nbsp;the big soft-water cistern&nbsp;which was on the north side of the house.</a></p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-267">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-268">3-C</a><br /></p>
<p>"It's a funny, dilapidated old place," he said to the girls, as he sat at breakfast.</p>
<p>His eyes were wise and childish, with thinking about things. He did not say much, but ate largely. March kept her face averted. She, too, in the early morning could not be aware of him, though something about the glint of his khaki reminded her of the brilliance of her dream-fox.</p>
<p>During the day the girls went about their business. In the morning he attended to the guns, shot a rabbit and a wild duck that was flying high towards the wood. That was a great addition to the empty larder. The girls felt that already he had earned his keep. He said nothing about leaving, however. In the afternoon he went to the village. He came back at tea-time. He had the same alert, forward-reaching look on his roundish face. He hung his hat on a peg with a little swinging gesture. He was thinking about something.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-3">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-4">3-D</a><br /></p>
<p>"Well," he said to the girls, as he sat at table. "What am I going to do?"</p>
<p>"How do you mean --- what are you going to do?" said Banford.</p>
<p>"Where am I going to find a place in the village to stay?" he said.</p>
<p>"I don't know," said Banford. "Where do you think of staying?"</p>
<p>"Well" --- he hesitated --- "<a href="#calibre_link-5">at the Swan they've got this flu, and at&nbsp;the Plough and Harrow&nbsp;they've got the soldiers who are collecting the hay for the army</a>: besides, in the private houses, there's ten men and a corporal altogether billeted in the village, they tell me. I'm not sure where I could get a bed."</p>
<p>He left the matter to them. He was rather calm about it. March sat with her elbows on the table, her two hands supporting her chin, looking at him unconsciously. Suddenly he lifted his clouded blue eyes, and unthinking looked straight into March's eyes. He was startled as well as she. He, too, recoiled a little. March felt the same sly, taunting, knowing spark leap out of his eyes, as he turned his head aside, and fall into her soul, as it had fallen from the dark eyes of the fox. She pursed her mouth as if in pain, as if asleep too.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-143">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-144">3-E</a><br /></p>
<p>"Well, I don't know," Banford was saying. She seemed reluctant, as if she were afraid of being imposed upon. She looked at March. But, with her weak, troubled sight, she only saw the usual semi-abstraction on her friend's face. "Why don't you speak, Nellie?" she said.</p>
<p>But March was wide-eyed and silent, and the youth, as if fascinated, was watching her without moving his eyes.</p>
<p>"Go on --- answer something," said Banford. And March turned her head slightly aside, as if coming to consciousness, or trying to come to consciousness.</p>
<p>"What do you expect me to say?" she asked automatically.</p>
<p>"Say what you think," said Banford.</p>
<p>"It's all the same to me," said March.</p>
<p>And again there was silence. A pointed light seemed to be on the boy's eyes, penetrating like a needle.</p>
<p>"So it is to me," said Banford. "You can stop on here if you like."</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-431">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-432">3-F</a><br /></p>
<p>A smile like a cunning little flame came over his face, suddenly and involuntarily. He dropped his head quickly to hide it, and remained with his head dropped, his face hidden.</p>
<p>"You can stop on here if you like. You can please yourself, Henry," Banford concluded.</p>
<p>Still he did not reply, but remained with his head dropped. Then he lifted his face. It was bright with a curious light, as if exultant, and his eyes were strangely clear as he watched March. She turned her face aside, her mouth suffering as if wounded, and her consciousness dim.</p>
<p>Banford became a little puzzled. She watched the steady, pellucid gaze of the youth's eyes as he looked at March, with the invisible smile gleaming on his face. She did not know how he was smiling, for no feature moved. It seemed only in the gleam, almost the glitter of the fine hairs on his cheeks. Then he looked with quite a changed look at Banford.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-657">

<p>"I'm sure," he said in his soft, courteous voice, "you're awfully good. You're too good. You don't want to be bothered with me, I'm sure."</p>
<p>"Cut a bit of bread, Nellie," said Banford uneasily, adding: "It's no bother, if you like to stay. It's like having my own brother here for a few days. He's a boy like you are."</p>
<p>"That's awfully kind of you," the lad repeated. "I should like to stay ever so much, if you're sure I'm not a trouble to you."</p>
<p>"No, of course you're no trouble. I tell you, it's a pleasure to have somebody in the house besides ourselves," said warm-hearted Banford.</p>
<p>"But Miss March?" he said in his soft voice, looking at her.</p>
<p>"Oh, it's quite all right as far as I'm concerned," said March vaguely.</p>
<p>His face beamed, and he almost rubbed his hands with pleasure.</p>
<p>"Well then," he said, "I should love it, if you'd let me pay my board and help with the work."</p>
<p>"You've no need to talk about board," said Banford.</p>

<p>One or two days went by, and the youth stayed on at the farm. Banford was quite charmed by him. He was so soft and courteous in speech, not wanting to say much himself, preferring to hear what she had to say, and to laugh in his quick, half-mocking way. He helped readily with the work --- but not too much. He loved to be out alone with the gun in his hands, to watch, to see. For his sharp-eyed, impersonal curiosity was insatiable, and he was most free when he was quite alone, half-hidden, watching.</p>
<p>Particularly he watched March. She was a strange character to him. Her figure, like a graceful young man's, piqued him. Her dark eyes made something rise in his soul, with a curious elate excitement, when he looked into them, an excitement he was afraid to let be seen, it was so keen and secret. And then her odd, shrewd speech made him laugh outright. He felt he must go further, he was inevitably impelled. But he put away the thought of her and went off towards the wood's edge with the gun.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-571">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-572">4-B</a><br /></p>
<p>The dusk was falling as he came home, and with the dusk, a fine, late November rain. He saw the fire-light leaping in the window of the sitting-room, a leaping light in the little cluster of the dark buildings. And he thought to himself it would be a good thing to have this place for his own. And then the thought entered him shrewdly: why not marry March? He stood still in the middle of the field for some moments, the dead rabbit hanging still in his hand, arrested by this thought. His mind waited in amazement --- it seemed to calculate --- and then he smiled curiously to himself in acquiescence. Why not? Why not indeed? It was a good idea. What if it was rather ridiculous? What did it matter? What if she was older than he? It didn't matter. When he thought of her dark, startled, vulnerable eyes he smiled subtly to himself. He was older than she, really. He was master of her.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-735">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-736">4-C</a><br /></p>
<p>He scarcely admitted his intention even to himself. He kept it as a secret even from himself. It was all too uncertain as yet. He would have to see how things went. Yes, he would have to see how things went. If he wasn't careful, she would just simply mock at the idea. He knew, sly and subtle as he was, that if he went to her plainly and said: "Miss March, I love you and want you to marry me," her inevitable answer would be: "Get out. I don't want any of that tomfoolery." This was her attitude to men and their "tomfoolery." If he was not careful, she would turn round on him with her savage, sardonic ridicule, and dismiss him from the farm and from her own mind for ever. He would have to go gently. He would have to catch her as you catch a deer or a woodcock when you go out shooting. It's no good walking out into the forest and saying to the deer: "Please fall to my gun." No, it is a slow, subtle battle. When you really go out to get a deer, you gather yourself together, you coil yourself inside yourself, and you advance secretly, before dawn, into the mountains. It is not so much what you do, when you go out hunting, as how you feel. You have to be subtle and cunning and absolutely fatally ready. It becomes like a fate. Your own fate overtakes and determines the fate of the deer you are hunting. First of all, even before you come in sight of your quarry, there is a strange battle, like mesmerism. Your own soul, as a hunter, has gone out to fasten on the soul of the deer, even before you see any deer. And the soul of the deer fights to escape. Even before the deer has any wind of you, it is so. It is a subtle, profound battle of wills which takes place in the invisible. And it is a battle never finished till your bullet goes home. When you are really worked up to the true pitch, and you come at last into range, you don't then aim as you do when you are firing at a bottle. It is your own will which carries the bullet into the heart of your quarry. The bullet's flight home is a sheer projection of your own fate into the fate of the deer. It happens like a supreme wish, a supreme act of volition, not as a dodge of cleverness.</p>

<div id="calibre_link-217">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-218">4-D</a><br /></p>
<p>He was a huntsman in spirit, not a farmer, and not a soldier stuck in a regiment. And it was as a young hunter that he wanted to bring down March as his quarry, to make her his wife. So he gathered himself subtly together, seemed to withdraw into a kind of invisibility. He was not quite sure how he would go on. And March was suspicious as a hare. So he remained in appearance just the nice, odd stranger-youth, staying for a fortnight on the place.</p>
<p>He had been sawing logs for the fire in the afternoon. Darkness came very early. It was still a cold, raw mist. It was getting almost too dark to see. A pile of short sawed logs lay beside the trestle. March came to carry them indoors, or into the shed, as he was busy sawing the last log. He was working in his shirt-sleeves, and did not notice her approach; she came unwillingly, as if shy. He saw her stooping to the bright-ended logs, and he stopped sawing. A fire like lightning flew down his legs in the nerves.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-341">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-342">4-E</a><br /></p>
<p>"March?" he said, in his quiet, young voice.</p>
<p>She looked up from the logs she was piling.</p>
<p>"Yes!" she said.</p>
<p>He looked down on her in the dusk. He could see her not too distinctly.</p>
<p>"I wanted to ask you something," he said.</p>
<p>"Did you? What was it?" she said. Already the fright was in her voice. But she was too much mistress of herself.</p>
<p>"Why" --- his voice seemed to draw out soft and subtle, it penetrated her nerves --- "why, what do you think it is?"</p>
<p>She stood up, placed her hands on her hips, and stood looking at him transfixed, without answering. Again he burned with a sudden power.</p>
<p>"Well," he said, and his voice was so soft it seemed rather like a subtle touch, like the merest touch of a cat's paw, a feeling rather than a sound." Well --- I wanted to ask you to marry me."</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-53">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-54">4-F</a><br /></p>
<p>March felt rather than heard him. She was trying in vain to turn aside her face. A great relaxation seemed to have come over her. She stood silent, her head slightly on one side. He seemed to be bending towards her, invisibly smiling. It seemed to her fine sparks came out of him.</p>
<p>Then very suddenly she said:</p>
<p>"Don't try any of your tomfoolery on me."</p>
<p>A quiver went over his nerves. He had missed. He waited a moment to collect himself again. Then he said, putting all the strange softness into his voice, as if he were imperceptibly stroking her:</p>
<p>"Why, it's not tomfoolery. It's not tomfoolery. I mean it. I mean it. What makes you disbelieve me?"</p>
<p>He sounded hurt. And his voice had such a curious power over her; making her feel loose and relaxed. She struggled somewhere for her own power. She felt for a moment that she was lost --- lost --- lost. The word seemed to rock in her as if she were dying. Suddenly again she spoke.</p>
<p>"You don't know what you are talking about," she said, in a brief and transient stroke of scorn. "What nonsense! I'm old enough to be your mother."</p>
<p>"Yes, I do know what I'm talking about. Yes, I do," he persisted softly, as if he were producing his voice in her blood. "I know quite well what I'm talking about. You're not old enough to be my mother. That isn't true. And what does it matter even if it was. You can marry me whatever age we are. What is age to me? And what is age to you! Age is nothing."</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-227">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-228">4-G</a><br /></p>
<p>A swoon went over her as he concluded. He spoke rapidly --- in the rapid Cornish fashion --- and his voice seemed to sound in her somewhere where she was helpless against it. "Age is nothing!" The soft, heavy insistence of it made her sway dimly out there in the darkness. She could not answer.</p>
<p>A great exultance leaped like fire over his limbs. He felt he had won.</p>
<p>"I want to marry you, you see. Why shouldn't I?" he proceeded, soft and rapid. He waited for her to answer. In the dusk he saw her almost phosphorescent. Her eyelids were dropped, her face half-averted and unconscious. She seemed to be in his power. But he waited, watchful. He dared not yet touch her.</p>
<p>"Say then," he said, "say then you'll marry me. Say --- say!" He was softly insistent.</p>
<p>"What?" she asked, faint, from a distance, like one in pain. His voice was now unthinkably near and soft. He drew very near to her.</p>
<p>"Say yes."</p>
<p>"Oh, I can't," she wailed helplessly, half-articulate, as if semi-conscious, and as if in pain, like one who dies. "How can I?"</p>
<p>"You can," he said softly, laying his hand gently on her shoulder as she stood with her head averted and dropped, dazed. "You can. Yes, you can. What makes you say you can't? You can. You can." And with awful softness he bent forward and just touched her neck with his mouth and his chin.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-331">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-332">2-N</a><br /></p>
<p>There was a moment's blank pause.</p>
<p>"What do you say, Nellie?" asked Banford.</p>
<p>"I don't mind," said March, in her distinct tone. "The village doesn't matter to me, anyhow."</p>
<p>"No," said the youth, quick and soft. "Why should it? I mean, what should they say?"</p>
<p>"Oh, well," came March's plangent, laconic voice, "they'll easily find something to say. But it makes no difference what they say. We can look after ourselves."</p>
<p>"Of course you can," said the youth.</p>
<p>"Well then, stop if you like," said Banford. "The spare room is quite ready."</p>
<p>His face shone with pleasure.</p>
<p>"If you're quite sure it isn't troubling you too much," he said, with that soft courtesy which distinguished him.</p>
<p>"Oh, it's no trouble," they both said.</p>
<p>He looked, smiling with delight, from one to another.</p>
<p>"It's awfully nice not to have to turn out again, isn't it?" he said gratefully.</p>
<p>"I suppose it is," said Banford.</p>
<p></p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-562">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-563">4-H</a><br /></p>
<p>"Don't!" she cried, with a faint mad cry like hysteria, starting away and facing round on him. "What do you mean?" But she had no breath to speak with. It was as if she was killed.</p>
<p>"I mean what I say," he persisted softly and cruelly. "I want you to marry me. I want you to marry me. You know that, now, don't you? You know that, now? Don't you? Don't you?"</p>
<p>"What?" she said.</p>
<p>"Know," he replied.</p>
<p>"Yes," she said. "I know you say so."</p>
<p>"And you know I mean it, don't you?"</p>
<p>"I know you say so."</p>
<p>"You believe me?" he said.</p>
<p>She was silent for some time. Then she pursed her lips.</p>
<p>"I don't know what I believe," she said.</p>
<p>"Are you out there?" came Banford's voice, calling from the house.</p>
<p>"Yes, we're bringing in the logs," he answered.</p>
<p>"I thought you'd gone lost," said Banford disconsolately. "Hurry up, do, and come and Let's have tea. The kettle's boiling."</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-730">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-137">4-I</a><br /></p>
<p>He stooped at once to take an armful of little logs and carry them into the kitchen, where they were piled in a corner. March also helped, filling her arms and carrying the logs on her breast as if they were some heavy child. The night had fallen cold.</p>
<p>When the logs were all in,<a href="#calibre_link-511"> the two cleaned their boots noisily on the scraper outside,</a>&nbsp;then rubbed them on the mat.&nbsp;<a href="#calibre_link-512">March shut the door and took off her old felt hat --- her farm-girl hat.&nbsp;</a>Her thick, crisp, black hair was loose, her face was pale and strained. She pushed back her hair vaguely, and washed her hands. Banford came hurrying into the dimly-lighted kitchen,&nbsp;<a href="#calibre_link-513">to&nbsp;take from the oven the scones she was keeping hot.</a></p>
<p>"Whatever have you been doing all this time?" she asked fretfully. "I thought you were never coming in. And it's ages since you stopped sawing. What were you doing out there?"</p>
<p>"Well," said Henry, "we had to stop that hole in the barn, to keeps the rats out."</p>
<p>"Why, I could see you standing there in the shed. I could see your shirt-sleeves," challenged Banford.</p>
<p>"Yes, I was just putting the saw away."</p>

<div id="calibre_link-419">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-420">5-A</a><br /></p>
<p>They went in to tea. March was quite mute. Her face was pale and strained and vague. The youth, who always had the same ruddy, self-contained look on his face, as though he were keeping himself to himself, had come to tea in his shirt-sleeves as if he were at home. He bent over his plate as he ate his food.</p>
<p>"Aren't you cold?" said Banford spitefully. "In your shirt-sleeves."</p>
<p>He looked up at her, with his chin near his plate, and his eyes very clear, pellucid, and unwavering as he watched her.</p>
<p>"No, I'm not cold," he said with his usual soft courtesy. "It's much warmer in here than it is outside, you see."</p>
<p>"I hope it is," said Banford, feeling nettled by him. He had a strange suave assurance, and a wide-eyed bright look that got on her nerves this evening.</p>
<p>"But perhaps," he said softly and courteously, "you don't like me coming to tea without my coat. I forgot that."</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't mind," said Banford: although she did.</p>
<p>"I'll go and get it, shall I?" he said.</p>
<p>March's dark eyes turned slowly down to him.</p>
<p>"No, don't you bother," she said in her queer, twanging tone. "If you feel all right as you are, stop as you are." She spoke with a crude authority.</p>
<p>"Yes," said he, "I feel all right, if I'm not rude."</p>
<p>"It's usually considered rude," said Banford. "But we don't mind."</p>
<p>"Go along, "considered rude"," ejaculated March. "Who considers it rude?"</p>
<p>"Why, you do, Nellie, in anybody else," said Banford, bridling a little behind her spectacles, and feeling her food stick in her throat.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-649">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-16">5-B</a><br /></p>
<p>But March had again gone vague and unheeding, chewing her food as if she did not know she was eating at all. And the youth looked from one to another, with bright, watching eyes.</p>
<p>Banford was offended. For all his suave courtesy and soft voice, the youth seemed to her impudent. She did not like to look at him. She did not like to meet his clear, watchful eyes, she did not like to see the strange glow in his face, his cheeks with their delicate fine hair, and his ruddy skin that was quite dull and yet which seemed to burn with a curious heat of life. It made her feel a little ill to look at him: the quality of his physical presence was too penetrating, too hot.</p>
<p>After tea the evening was very quiet. The youth rarely went into the village. As a rule he read: he was a great reader, in his own hours. That is, when he did begin, he read absorbedly. But he was not very eager to begin.<a href="#calibre_link-206">Often he walked about the fields and along the hedges alone in the dark at night, prowling with a queer instinct for the night, and listening to the wild sounds.</a></p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-348">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-242">5-C</a><br /></p>
<p>To-night, however,&nbsp;<a href="#calibre_link-349">he took a Captain Mayne Reid book from Banford's shelf</a>&nbsp;and sat down with knees wide apart and immersed himself in his story. His brownish fair hair was long, and lay on his head like a thick cap, combed sideways. He was still in his shirt-sleeves, and bending forward under the lamp-light, with his knees stuck wide apart and the book in his hand and his whole figure absorbed in the rather strenuous business of reading, he gave Banford's sitting-room the look of a lumber-camp. She resented this. For on her sitting-room floor she had a red Turkey rug and dark stain round, the fire-place had fashionable green tiles, the piano stood open with the latest dance-music: she played quite well: and on the walls were March's hand-painted swans and water-lilies. Moreover, with the logs nicely, tremulously burning in the grate, the thick curtains drawn, the doors all shut, and the pine-trees hissing and shuddering in the wind outside, it was cosy, it was refined and nice. She resented the big, raw, long-legged youth sticking his khaki knees out and sitting there with his soldier's shirt-cuffs buttoned on his thick red wrists. From time to time he turned a page, and from time to time he gave a sharp look at the fire, settling the logs. Then he immersed himself again in the intense and isolated business of reading.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-359">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-360">5-D</a><br /></p>
<p><a href="#calibre_link-180">March, on the far side of the table, was spasmodically crochetting.</a>&nbsp;Her mouth was pursed in an odd way, as when she had dreamed the fox's brush burned it, her beautiful, crisp black hair strayed in wisps. But her whole figure was absorbed in its bearing, as if she herself was miles away. In a sort of semi-dream she seemed to be hearing the fox singing round the house in the wind, singing wildly and sweetly and like a madness. With red but well-shaped hands she slowly crochetted the white cotton, very slowly, awkwardly.</p>
<p>Banford was also trying to read, sitting in her low chair. But between those two she felt fidgety. She kept moving and looking round and listening to the wind, and glancing secretly from one to the other of her companions. March, seated on a straight chair, with her knees in their close breeches crossed, and slowly, laboriously crochetting, was also a trial.</p>
<p>"Oh dear!" said Banford, "My eyes are bad to-night." And she pressed her fingers on her eyes.</p>
<p>The youth looked up at her with his clear, bright look, but did not speak.</p>
<p>"Are they, Jill?" said March absently.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-677">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-632">5-E</a><br /></p>
<p>Then the youth began to read again, and Banford perforce returned to her book. But she could not keep still. After a while she looked up at March, and a queer, almost malignant little smile was on her thin face.</p>
<p><a href="#calibre_link-239">"A penny for them, Nell," she said suddenly.</a><br /></p>
<p>March looked round with big, startled black eyes, and went pale as if with terror. She had been listening to the fox singing so tenderly, so tenderly, as he wandered round the house.</p>
<p>"What?" she said vaguely.</p>
<p>"A penny for them," said Banford sarcastically. "<a href="#calibre_link-239">Or twopence, if they're as deep as all that.</a>"</p>
<p>The youth was watching with bright, clear eyes from beneath the lamp.</p>
<p>"Why," came March's vague voice, "what do you want to waste your money for?"</p>
<p>"I thought it would be well spent," said Banford.</p>
<p>"I wasn't thinking of anything except the way the wind was blowing," said March.</p>
<p>"Oh dear," replied Banford, "I could have had as original thoughts as that myself. I'm afraid I have wasted my money this time."</p>
<p>"Well, you needn't pay," said March.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-243">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-238">5-F</a><br /></p>
<p>The youth suddenly laughed. Both women looked at him: March rather surprised-looking, as if she had hardly known he was there.</p>
<p>"Why, do you ever pay up on these occasions?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Oh yes," said Banford. "We always do.&nbsp;<a href="#calibre_link-244">I've sometimes had to pass a shilling a week to Nellie, in the winter time.</a>&nbsp;It costs much less in summer."</p>
<p>"What, paying for each other's thoughts?" he laughed.</p>
<p>"Yes, when we've absolutely come to the end of everything else."</p>
<p>He laughed quickly, wrinkling his nose sharply like a puppy and laughing with quick pleasure, his eyes shining.</p>
<p>"It's the first time I ever heard of that," he said.</p>
<p>"I guess you'd hear of it often enough if you stayed a winter on Bailey Farm," said Banford lamentably.</p>
<p>"Do you get so tired, then?" he asked.</p>
<p>"So bored," said Banford.</p>
<p>"Oh!" he said gravely. "But why should you be bored?"</p>
<p>"Who wouldn't be bored?" said Banford.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry to hear that," he said gravely.</p>
<p>"You must be, if you were hoping to have a lively time here," said Banford.</p>
<p>He looked at her long and gravely.</p>
<p>"Well," he said, with his odd, young seriousness, "it's quite lively enough for me."</p>
<p>"I'm glad to hear it," said Banford.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-586">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-587">5-G</a><br /></p>
<p>And she returned to her book. In her thin, frail hair were already many threads of grey, though she was not yet thirty. The boy did not look down, but turned his eyes to March, who was sitting with pursed mouth laboriously crochetting, her eyes wide and absent. She had a warm, pale, fine skin, and a delicate nose. Her pursed mouth looked shrewish. But the shrewish look was contradicted by the curious lifted arch of her dark brows, and the wideness of her eyes; a look of startled wonder and vagueness. She was listening again for the fox, who seemed to have wandered further off into the night.</p>
<p>From under the edge of the lamp-light the boy sat with his face looking up, watching her silently, his eyes round and very clear and intent. Banford, biting her fingers irritably, was glancing at him under her hair. He sat there perfectly still, his ruddy face tilted up from the low level under the light, on the edge of the dimness, and watching with perfect abstract intentness. March suddenly lifted her great, dark eyes from her crochetting, and saw him. She started, giving a little exclamation.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-127">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-128">5-H</a><br /></p>
<p>"There he is!" she cried involuntarily, as if terribly startled.</p>
<p>Banford looked round in amazement, sitting up straight.</p>
<p>"Whatever has got you, Nellie?" she cried.</p>
<p>But March, her face flushed a delicate rose colour, was looking away to the door.</p>
<p>"Nothing! Nothing!" she said crossly. "Can't one speak?"</p>
<p>"Yes, if you speak sensibly," said Banford. "Whatever did you mean?"</p>
<p>"I don't know what I meant," cried March testily.</p>
<p>"Oh, Nellie, I hope you aren't going jumpy and nervy. I feel I can't stand another thing! Whoever did you mean? Did you mean Henry?" cried poor, frightened Banford.</p>
<p>"Yes. I suppose so," said March laconically. She would never confess to the fox.</p>
<p>"Oh dear, my nerves are all gone for to-night," wailed Banford.</p>
<p>At nine o'clock March brought in a tray with bread and cheese and tea --- Henry had confessed that he liked a cup of tea. Banford drank a glass of milk, and ate a little bread. And soon she said:</p>
<p>"I'm going to bed, Nellie, I'm all nerves to-night. Are you coming?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm coming the minute I've taken the tray away," said March.</p>
<p>"Don't be long then," said Banford fretfully. "Good-night, Henry. You'll see the fire is safe, if you come up last, won't you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Miss Banford, I'll see it's safe," he replied in his reassuring way.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-354">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-355">5-I</a><br /></p>
<p>March was lighting the candle to go to the kitchen. Banford took her candle and went upstairs. When March came back to the fire, she said to him:</p>
<p>"I suppose we can trust you to put out the fire and everything?" She stood there with her hand on her hip, and one knee loose, her head averted shyly, as if she could not look at him. He had his face lifted, watching her.</p>
<p>"Come and sit down a minute," he said softly.</p>
<p>"No, I'll be going. Jill will be waiting, and she'll get upset, if I don't come."</p>
<p>"What made you jump like that this evening?" he asked.</p>
<p>"When did I jump?" she retorted, looking at him.</p>
<p>"Why, just now you did," he said. "When you cried out."</p>
<p>"Oh!" she said. "Then! --- Why, I thought you were the fox!" And her face screwed into a queer smile, half-ironic.</p>
<p>"The fox! Why the fox?" he asked softly.</p>
<p>"Why, one evening last summer when I was out with the gun I saw the fox in the grass nearly at my feet, looking straight up at me. I don't know --- I suppose he made an impression on me." She turned aside her head again, and let one foot stray loose, self-consciously.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-345">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-346">5-J</a><br /></p>
<p>"And did you shoot him?" asked the boy.</p>
<p>"No,&nbsp;<a href="#calibre_link-347">he gave me such a start, staring straight at me as he did</a>, and then stopping to look back at me over his shoulder with a laugh on his face."</p>
<p>"A laugh on his face!" repeated Henry, also laughing. "He frightened you, did he?"</p>
<p>"No, he didn't frighten me. He made an impression on me, that's all."</p>
<p>"And you thought I was the fox, did you?" he laughed, with the same queer, quick little laugh, like a puppy wrinkling his nose.</p>
<p>"Yes, I did, for the moment," she said. "Perhaps he'd been in my mind without my knowing."</p>
<p>"Perhaps you think I've come to steal your chickens or something," he said, with the same young laugh.</p>
<p>But she only looked at him with a wide, dark, vacant eye.</p>
<p>"It's the first time," he said, "that I've ever been taken for a fox. Won't you sit down for a minute?" His voice was very soft and cajoling.</p>
<p>"No," she said. "Jill will be waiting." But still she did not go, but stood with one foot loose and her face turned aside, just outside the circle of light.</p>
<p>"But won't you answer my question?" he said, lowering his voice still more.</p>
<p>"I don't know what question you mean."</p>
<p>"Yes, you do. Of course you do. I mean the question of you marrying me."</p>
<p>"No, I shan't answer that question," she said flatly.</p>
<p>"Won't you?" The queer, young laugh came on his nose again. "Is it because I'm like the fox? Is that why?" And still he laughed.</p>
<p>She turned and looked at him with a long, slow look.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't let that put you against me," he said. "Let me turn the lamp low, and come and sit down a minute."</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-575">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-576">5-K</a><br /></p>
<p>He put his red hand under the glow of the lamp, and suddenly made the light very dim. March stood there in the dimness quite shadowy, but unmoving. He rose silently to his feet, on his long legs. And now his voice was extraordinarily soft and suggestive, hardly audible.</p>
<p>"You'll stay a moment," he said. "Just a moment." And he put his hand on her shoulder. She turned her face from him. "I'm sure you don't really think I'm like the fox," he said, with the same softness and with a suggestion of laughter in his tone, a subtle mockery. "Do you now?" And he drew her gently towards him and kissed her neck, softly. She winced and trembled and hung away. But his strong, young arm held her, and he kissed her softly again, still on the neck, for her face was averted.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-1">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-2">5-L</a><br /></p>
<p>"Won't you answer my question? Won't you now?" came his soft, lingering voice. He was trying to draw her near to kiss her face. And he kissed her cheek softly, near the ear.</p>
<p>At that moment Banford's voice was heard calling fretfully, crossly from upstairs.</p>
<p>"There's Jill!" cried March, starting and drawing erect.</p>
<p>And as she did so, quick as lightning he kissed her on the mouth, with a quick brushing kiss. It seemed to burn through her every fibre. She gave a queer little cry.</p>
<p>"You will, won't you? You will?" he insisted softly.</p>
<p>"Nellie! Nellie! Whatever are you so long for?" came Banford's faint cry from the outer darkness.</p>
<p>But he held her fast, and was murmuring with that intolerable softness and insistency:</p>
<p>"You will, won't you? Say yes! Say yes!"</p>
<p>March, who felt as if the fire had gone through her and scathed her, and as if she could do no more, murmured:</p>
<p>"Yes! Yes! Anything you like! Anything you like! Only let me go! Only let me go! Jill's calling."</p>
<p>"You know you've promised," he said insidiously.</p>
<p>"Yes! Yes! I do!" Her voice suddenly rose into a shrill cry. "All right, Jill, I'm coming."</p>
<p>Startled, he let her go, and she went straight upstairs.</p>
<p></p>

<h3><b>Scene 6<br /><b></b></b></h3>
<p>翌朝、ヘンリーはバンフォードに結婚の報告をします。ショックを受けたバンフォードは辛辣なことばをヘンリーに浴びせます。ふたりの間に流れる不穏な空気をマーチは楽しんでいました。</p>
<p>その夜、ふたりが寝室で話している内容を盗み聞きしようと、ヘンリーはそっとドアの前で耳をそばだてました。</p>
<p>＊＊＊＊＊＊</p>
<p><a href="#calibre_link-212">Q6</a><br /></p>
<p>バンフォードがいうtheir levelとは何のことでしょうか。（6-H）</p>
<div><br /></div>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-559">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-560">6-A</a><br /></p>
<p>In the morning at breakfast, after he had looked round the place and attended to the stock and thought to himself that one could live easily enough here, he said to Banford:"Do you know what, Miss Banford?"</p>
<p>"Well, what?" said the good-natured, nervy Banford.</p>
<p>He looked at March, who was spreading jam on her bread.</p>
<p>"Shall I tell?" he said to her.</p>
<p>She looked up at him, and a deep pink colour flushed over her face.</p>
<p>"Yes, if you mean Jill," she said. "I hope you won't go talking all over the village, that's all." And she swallowed her dry bread with difficulty.</p>
<p>"Whatever's coming?" said Banford, looking up with wide, tired, slightly reddened eyes. She was a thin, frail little thing, and her hair, which was delicate and thin, was bobbed, so it hung softly by her worn face in its faded brown and grey.</p>
<p>"Why, what do you think?" he said, smiling like one who has a secret.</p>
<p>"How do I know!" said Banford.</p>
<p>"Can't you guess?" he said, making bright eyes, and smiling, pleased with himself.</p>
<p>"I'm sure I can't. What's more, I'm not going to try."</p>
<p>"Nellie and I are going to be married."</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-94">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-95">6-B</a><br /></p>
<p>Banford put down her knife out of her thin, delicate fingers, as if she would never take it up to eat any more. She stared with blank, reddened eyes.</p>
<p>"You what?" she exclaimed.</p>
<p>"We're going to get married. Aren't we, Nellie?" and he turned to March.</p>
<p>"You say so, anyway," said March laconically. But again she flushed with an agonized flush. She, too, could swallow no more.</p>
<p>Banford looked at her like a bird that has been shot: a poor, little sick bird. She gazed at her with all her wounded soul in her face, at the deep-flushed March.</p>
<p>"Never!" she exclaimed, helpless.</p>
<p>"It's quite right," said the bright and gloating youth.</p>
<p>Banford turned aside her face, as if the sight of the food on the table made her sick. She sat like this for some moments, as if she were sick. Then, with one hand on the edge of the table, she rose to her feet.</p>
<p>"I'll never believe it, Nellie," she cried. "It's absolutely impossible!"</p>
<p>Her plaintive, fretful voice had a thread of hot anger and despair.</p>
<p>"Why? Why shouldn't you believe it?" asked the youth, with all his soft, velvety impertinence in his voice.</p>
<p>Banford looked at him from her wide, vague eyes, as if he were some creature in a museum.</p>
<p>"Oh," she said languidly, "because she can never be such a fool. She can't lose her self-respect to such an extent." Her voice was cold and plaintive, drifting.</p>
<p>"In what way will she lose her self-respect?" asked the boy.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-114">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-115">6-C</a><br /></p>
<p>Banford looked at him with vague fixity from behind her spectacles.</p>
<p>"If she hasn't lost it already," she said.</p>
<p>He became very red, vermilion, under the slow, vague stare from behind the spectacles.</p>
<p>"I don't see it at all," he said.</p>
<p>"Probably you don't. I shouldn't expect you would," said Banford, with that straying mild tone of remoteness which made her words even more insulting.</p>
<p>He sat stiff in his chair, staring with hot, blue eyes from his scarlet face. An ugly look had come on his brow.</p>
<p>"My word, she doesn't know what she's letting herself in for," said Banford, in her plaintive, drifting, insulting voice.</p>
<p>"What has it got to do with you, anyway?" said the youth, in a temper.</p>
<p>"More than it has to do with you, probably," she replied, plaintive and venomous.</p>
<p>"Oh, has it! I don't see that at all," he jerked out.</p>
<p>"No, you wouldn't," she answered, drifting.</p>
<p>"Anyhow," said March, pushing back her chair and rising uncouthly. "It's no good arguing about it." And she seized the bread and the tea-pot, and strode away to the kitchen.</p>
<p>Banford let her fingers stray across her brow and along her hair, like one bemused. Then she turned and went away upstairs.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-337">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-338">6-D</a><br /></p>
<p>Henry sat stiff and sulky in his chair, with his face and his eyes on fire. March came and went, clearing the table. But Henry sat on, stiff with temper. He took no notice of her. She had regained her composure and her soft, even, creamy complexion. But her mouth was pursed up. She glanced at him each time as she came to take things from the table, glanced from her large, curious eyes, more in curiosity than anything. Such a long, red-faced, sulky boy! That was all he was. He seemed as remote from her as if his red face were a red chimney-pot on a cottage across the fields, and she looked at him just as objectively, as remotely.</p>
<p>At length he got up and stalked out into the fields with the gun. He came in only at dinner-time, with the devil still in his face, but his manners quite polite. Nobody said anything particular; they sat each one at the sharp corner of a triangle, in obstinate remoteness. In the afternoon he went out again at once with the gun. He came in at nightfall with a rabbit and a pigeon. He stayed in all the evening, but hardly opened his mouth. He was in the devil of a temper, feeling he had been insulted.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-581">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-582">6-E</a><br /></p>
<p>Banford's eyes were red, she had evidently been crying. But her manner was more remote and supercilious than ever; the way she turned her head if he spoke at all, as if he were some tramp or inferior intruder of that sort, made his blue eyes go almost black with rage. His face looked sulkier. But he never forgot his polite intonation, if he opened his mouth to speak.</p>
<p>March seemed to flourish in this atmosphere. She seemed to sit between the two antagonists with a little wicked smile on her face, enjoying herself. There was even a sort of complacency in the way she laboriously crocheted this evening.</p>
<p>When he was in bed, the youth could hear the two women talking and arguing in their room. He sat up in bed and strained his ears to hear what they said. But he could hear nothing, it was too far off. Yet he could hear the soft, plaintive drip of Banford's voice, and March's deeper note.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-733">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-734">6-F</a><br /></p>
<p>The night was quiet, frosty. Big stars were snapping outside, beyond the ridge-tops of the pine-trees. He listened and listened. In the distance he heard a fox yelping: and the dogs from the farms barking in answer. But it was not that he wanted to hear. It was what the two women were saying.</p>
<p>He got stealthily out of bed, and stood by his door. He could hear no more than before. Very, very carefully he began to lift the door latch. After quite a time he had his door open. Then he stepped stealthily out into the passage. The old oak planks were cold under his feet, and they creaked preposterously. He crept very, very gently up the one step, and along by the wall, till he stood outside their door. And there he held his breath and listened. Banford's voice:</p>
<p>"No, I simply couldn't stand it. I should be dead in a month. Which is just what he would be aiming at, of course. That would just be his game, to see me in the churchyard. No, Nellie, if you were to do such a thing as to marry him, you could never stop here. I couldn't, I couldn't live in the same house with him. Oh! --- h! I feel quite sick with the smell of his clothes. And his red face simply turns me over. I can't eat my food when he's at the table. What a fool I was ever to let him stop. One ought never to try to do a kind action. It always flies back in your face like a boomerang."</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-192">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-193">6-G</a><br /></p>
<p>"Well, he's only got two more days," said March.</p>
<p>"Yes, thank heaven. And when he's gone he'll never come in this house again. I feel so bad while he's here. And I know, I know he's only counting what he can get out of you. I know that's all it is. He's just a good-for-nothing, who doesn't want to work, and who thinks he'll live on us. But he won't live on me. If you're such a fool, then it's your own lookout. Mrs Burgess knew him all the time he was here. And the old man could never get him to do any steady work. He was off with the gun on every occasion, just as he is now. Nothing but the gun! Oh, I do hate it. You don't know what you're doing, Nellie, you don't. If you marry him he'll just make a fool of you. He'll go off and leave you stranded. I know he will, if he can't get Bailey Farm out of us --- and he's not going to, while I live. While I live he's never going to set foot here. I know what it would be. He'd soon think he was master of both of us, as he thinks he's master of you already."</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-666">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-667">6-H</a><br /></p>
<p>"But he isn't," said Nellie.</p>
<p>"He thinks he is, anyway. And that's what he wants: to come and be master here. Yes, imagine it! That's what we've got the place together for, is it, to be bossed and bullied by a hateful red-faced boy, a beastly labourer. Oh, we did make a mistake when we let him stop. We ought never to have lowered ourselves. And I've had such a fight with all the people here, not to be pulled down to their level. No, he's not coming here. And then you see --- if he can't have the place, he'll run off to Canada or somewhere again, as if he'd never known you. And here you'll be, absolutely ruined and made a fool of. I know I shall never have any peace of mind again."</p>
<p>"We'll tell him he can't come here. We'll tell him that," said March.</p>
<p>"Oh, don't you bother; I'm going to tell him that, and other things as well, before he goes. He's not going to have all his own way while I've got the strength left to speak. Oh, Nellie, he'll despise you, he'll despise you, like the awful little beast he is, if you give way to him. I'd no more trust him than I'd trust a cat not to steal. He's deep, he's deep, and he's bossy, and he's selfish through and through, as cold as ice. All he wants is to make use of you. And when you're no more use to him, then I pity you."</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-223">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-224">6-I</a><br /></p>
<p>"I don't think he's as bad as all that," said March.</p>
<p>"No, because he's been playing up to you. But you'll find out, if you see much of him. Oh, Nellie, I can't bear to think of it."</p>
<p>"Well, it won't hurt you, Jill, darling."</p>
<p>"Won't it! Won't it! I shall never know a moment's peace again while I live, nor a moment's happiness. No, Nellie ---" and Banford began to weep bitterly.</p>
<p>The boy outside could hear the stifled sound of the woman's sobbing, and could hear March's soft, deep, tender voice comforting, with wonderful gentleness and tenderness, the weeping woman.</p>

<h3><b>Scene 7<br /><b></b></b></h3>
<p>ふたりの考えを盗み聞いて、怒りのために寝付かれなくなったヘンリーは、銃を片手に外に出ます。ニワトリ小屋を見張っていると、そこにれいのキツネがやってきました。あわてることもなくヘンリーはキツネを仕留め、その銃音に驚いて起きたマーチとバンフォードに、死んだキツネを見せます。マーチはその夜、また夢を見ましたが、今度はバンフォードが亡くなった夢でした。</p>
<p>＊＊＊＊＊＊</p>
<p><a href="#calibre_link-479">Q7</a><br /></p>
<p>ヘンリーにとって、なぜイングランドが狭く小さく感じた（And suddenly, it seemed to him England was little and tight.）のでしょうか？（7-B）</p>
<div><br /></div>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-112">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-113">7-A</a><br /></p>
<p>His eyes were so round and wide that he seemed to see the whole night, and his ears were almost jumping off his head. He was frozen stiff. He crept back to bed, but felt as if the top of his head were coming off. He could not sleep. He could not keep still. He rose, quietly dressed himself, and crept out on to the landing once more. The women were silent. He went softly downstairs and out to the kitchen.</p>
<p>Then he put on his boots and his overcoat, and took the gun. He did not think to go away from the farm. No, he only took the gun. As softly as possible he unfastened the door and went out into the frosty December night. The air was still, the stars bright, the pine-trees seemed to bristle audibly in the sky. He went stealthily away down a fence-side, looking for something to shoot. At the same time he remembered that he ought not to shoot and frighten the women.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-423">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-80">7-B</a><br /></p>
<p><a href="#calibre_link-153">So he prowled round the edge of the gorse cover, and through the grove of tall old hollies, to the woodside.</a>&nbsp;There he skirted the fence, peering through the darkness with dilated eyes that seemed to be able to grow black and full of sight in the dark, like a cat's.&nbsp;<a href="#calibre_link-154">An owl was slowly and mournfully whooing round a great oak-tree.</a>&nbsp;He stepped stealthily with his gun, listening, listening, watching.</p>
<p>As he stood under the oaks of the wood-edge he heard the dogs from the neighbouring cottage up the hill yelling suddenly and startlingly, and the wakened dogs from the farms around barking answer. And suddenly, it seemed to him England was little and tight, he felt the landscape was constricted even in the dark, and that there were too many dogs in the night,&nbsp;<a href="#calibre_link-155">making a noise like a fence of sound, like the network of English hedges netting the view.</a>&nbsp;He felt the fox didn't have a chance. For it must be the fox that had started all this hullabaloo.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-729">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-302">7-C</a><br /></p>
<p>Why not watch for him, anyhow! He would, no doubt, be coming sniffing round. The lad walked downhill to where the farmstead with its few pine-trees crouched blackly. In the angle of the long shed, in the black dark, he crouched down. He knew the fox would be coming. It seemed to him it would be the last of the foxes in this loudly-barking, thick-voiced England, tight with innumerable little houses.</p>
<p><a href="#calibre_link-394">He sat a long time with his eyes fixed unchanging upon&nbsp;the open gateway</a>, where a little light seemed to fall from the stars or from the horizon, who knows. He was sitting on a log in a dark corner with the gun across his knees. The pine-trees snapped. Once a chicken fell off its perch in the barn with a loud crawk and cackle and commotion that startled him, and he stood up, watching with all his eyes, thinking it might be a rat. But he felt it was nothing. So he sat down again with the gun on his knees and his hands tucked in to keep them warm, and his eyes fixed unblinking on the pale reach of the open gateway. He felt he could smell the hot, sickly, rich smell of live chickens on the cold air.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-323">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-324">7-D</a><br /></p>
<p>And then --- a shadow. A sliding shadow in the gateway. He gathered all his vision into a concentrated spark, and saw the shadow of the fox, the fox creeping on his belly through the gate. There he went, on his belly like a snake. The boy smiled to himself and brought the gun to his shoulder. He knew quite well what would happen.<a href="#calibre_link-325"> He knew the fox would go to where the fowl-door was boarded up, and sniff there.</a>&nbsp;He knew he would lie there for a minute, sniffing the fowls within. And then he would start again prowling under the edge of the old barn, waiting to get in.</p>
<p>The fowl-door was at the top of a slight incline. Soft, soft as a shadow the fox slid up this incline, and crouched with his nose to the boards. And at the same moment there was the awful crash of a gun reverberating between the old buildings, as if all the night had gone smash. But the boy watched keenly. He saw even the white belly of the fox as the beast beat his paws in death. So he went forward.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-640">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-641">7-E</a><br /></p>
<p>There was a commotion everywhere. The fowls were scuffling and crawking, the ducks were quark-quarking, the pony had stamped wildly to his feet. But the fox was on his side, struggling in his last tremors. The boy bent over him and smelt his foxy smell.</p>
<p>There was a sound of a window opening upstairs, then March's voice calling:</p>
<p>"Who is it?"</p>
<p>"It's me," said Henry; "I've shot the fox."</p>
<p>"Oh, goodness! You nearly frightened us to death."</p>
<p>"Did I? I'm awfully sorry."</p>
<p>"Whatever made you get up?"</p>
<p>"I heard him about."</p>
<p>"And have you shot him?"</p>
<p>"Yes, he's here," and the boy stood in the yard holding up the warm, dead brute. "You can't see, can you? Wait a minute." And he took his flash-light from his pocket, and flashed it on to the dead animal. He was holding it by the brush. March saw, in the middle of the darkness, just the reddish fleece and the white belly and the white underneath of the pointed chin, and the queer, dangling paws. She did not know what to say.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-715">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-707">7-F</a><br /></p>
<p>"He's a beauty," he said. "He will make you a lovely fur."</p>
<p><a href="#calibre_link-233">"You don't catch me wearing a fox fur," she replied.</a><br /></p>
<p>"Oh!" he said. And he switched off the light.</p>
<p>"Well, I should think you'll come in and go to bed again now," she said.</p>
<p>"Probably I shall. What time is it?"</p>
<p>"What time is it, Jill?" called March's voice. It was a quarter to one.</p>
<p>That night March had another dream. She dreamed that Banford was dead, and that she, March, was sobbing her heart out. Then she had to put Banford into her coffin. And the coffin was the rough wood-box in which the bits of chopped wood were kept in the kitchen, by the fire. This was the coffin, and there was no other, and March was in agony and dazed bewilderment, looking for something to line the box with, something to make it soft with, something to cover up the poor, dead darling. Because she couldn't lay her in there just in her white, thin nightdress, in the horrible wood-box. So she hunted and hunted, and picked up thing after thing, and threw it aside in the agony of dream-frustration. And in her dream-despair all she could find that would do was a fox-skin. She knew that it wasn't right, that this was not what she should have. But it was all she could find. And so she folded the brush of the fox, and laid her darling Jill's head on this, and she brought round the skin of the fox and laid it on the top of the body, so that it seemed to make a whole ruddy, fiery coverlet, and she cried and cried, and woke to find the tears streaming down her face.</p>

<p>＊＊＊＊＊＊</p>
<p><a href="#calibre_link-425">Q8</a><br /></p>
<p>ヘンリーは、なぜ「ひどくそぐわない（He watched her, but he could make nothing of her.）」と思ったのでしょうか。（8-B）</p>

</div>
<div id="calibre_link-652">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-653">8-A</a><br /></p>
<p>The first thing that both she and Banford did in the morning was to go out to see the fox. Henry had hung it up by the heels in the shed, with its poor brush falling backwards. It was a lovely dog-fox in its prime, with a handsome, thick, winter coat: a lovely golden-red colour, with grey as it passed to the belly, and belly all white, and a great full brush with a delicate black and grey and pure white tip.</p>
<p>"Poor brute!" said Banford. "If it wasn't such a thieving wretch, you'd feel sorry for it."</p>
<p>March said nothing, but stood with her foot trailing aside, one hip out; her face was pale and her eyes big and black, watching the dead animal that was suspended upside down. White and soft as snow his belly: white and soft as snow. She passed her hand softly down it. And his wonderful black-glinted brush was full and frictional, wonderful. She passed her hand down this also, and quivered. Time after time she took the full fur of that thick tail between her fingers, and passed her hand slowly downwards. Wonderful, sharp, thick, splendour of a tail. And he was dead! She pursed her lips, and her eyes went black and vacant. Then she took the head in her hand.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-106">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-107">8-B</a><br /></p>
<p>Henry was sauntering up, so Banford walked rather pointedly away. March stood there bemused, with the head of the fox in her hand. She was wondering, wondering, wondering over his long, fine muzzle.&nbsp;<a href="#calibre_link-108">For some reason it reminded her of a spoon or a spatula.</a>&nbsp;She felt she could not understand it.<a href="#calibre_link-109"> The beast was a strange beast to her, incomprehensible, out of her range.</a>&nbsp;Wonderful silver whiskers he had, like ice-threads. And pricked ears with hair inside. But that long, long, slender spoon of a nose! --- and the marvellous white teeth beneath! It was to thrust forward and bite with, deep, deep into the living prey, to bite and bite the blood.</p>
<p>"He's a beauty, isn't he?" said Henry, standing by.</p>
<p>"Oh yes, he's a fine big fox. I wonder how many chickens he's responsible for," she replied.</p>
<p>"A good many. Do you think he's the same one you saw in the summer?"</p>
<p>"I should think very likely he is," she replied.</p>
<p>He watched her, but he could make nothing of her. Partly she was so shy and virgin, and partly she was so grim, matter-of-fact, shrewish. What she said seemed to him so different from the look of her big, queer, dark eyes.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-315">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-316">8-C</a><br /></p>
<p>"Are you going to skin him?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, when I've had breakfast, and got a board to peg him on."</p>
<p>"My word, what a strong smell he's got! Pooo! It'll take some washing off one's hands. I don't know why I was so silly as to handle him." And she looked at her right hand, that had passed down his belly and along his tail, and had even got a tiny streak of blood from one dark place in his fur.</p>
<p>"Have you seen the chickens when they smell him, how frightened they are?" he said.</p>
<p>"Yes, aren't they!"</p>
<p>"You must mind you don't get some of his fleas."</p>
<p>"Oh, fleas!" she replied, nonchalant.</p>
<p>Later in the day she saw the fox's skin nailed flat on a board, as if crucified. It gave her an uneasy feeling.</p>
<p>The boy was angry. He went about with his mouth shut, as if he had swallowed part of his chin. But in behaviour he was polite and affable. He did not say anything about his intention. And he left March alone.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-294">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-295">8-D</a><br /></p>
<p>That evening they sat in the dining-room. Banford wouldn't have him in her sitting-room any more. There was a very big log on the fire. And everybody was busy. Banford had letters to write, March was sewing a dress, and he was mending some little contrivance.</p>
<p>Banford stopped her letter-writing from time to time to look round and rest her eyes. The boy had his head down, his face hidden over his job.</p>
<p>"Let's see," said Banford. "What train do you go by, Henry?"</p>
<p>He looked up straight at her.</p>
<p>"The morning train. In the morning," he said.</p>
<p>"What, the eight-ten or the eleven-twenty?"</p>
<p>"The eleven-twenty, I suppose," he said.</p>
<p>"That is the day after to-morrow?" said Banford.</p>
<p>"Yes, the day after to-morrow."</p>
<p>"Mm!" murmured Banford, and she returned to her writing. But as she was licking her envelope, she asked:</p>
<p>"And what plans have you made for the future, if I may ask?"</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-623">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-624">8-E</a><br /></p>
<p>"Plans?" he said, his face very bright and angry.</p>
<p>"I mean about you and Nellie, if you are going on with this business. When do you expect the wedding to come off?" She spoke in a jeering tone.</p>
<p>"Oh, the wedding!" he replied. "I don't know."</p>
<p>"Don't you know anything?" said Banford. "Are you going to clear out on Friday and leave things no more settled than they are?"</p>
<p>"Well, why shouldn't I? We can always write letters."</p>
<p>"Yes, of course you can. But I wanted to know because of this place. If Nellie is going to get married all of a sudden, I shall have to be looking round for a new partner."</p>
<p>"Couldn't she stay on here if she were married?" he said. He knew quite well what was coming.</p>
<p>"Oh," said Banford, "this is no place for a married couple. There's not enough work to keep a man going, for one thing. And there's no money to be made. It's quite useless your thinking of staying on here if you marry. Absolutely!"</p>
<p>"Yes, but I wasn't thinking of staying on here," he said.</p>
<p>"Well, that's what I want to know. And what about Nellie, then? How long is she going to be here with me, in that case?"</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-176">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-177">8-F</a><br /></p>
<p>The two antagonists looked at one another.</p>
<p>"That I can't say," he answered.</p>
<p>"Oh, go along," she cried petulantly. "You must have some idea what you are going to do, if you ask a woman to marry you. Unless it's all a hoax."</p>
<p>"Why should it be a hoax? I am going back to Canada."</p>
<p>"And taking her with you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, certainly."</p>
<p>"You hear that, Nellie?" said Banford.</p>
<p>March, who had had her head bent over her sewing, now looked up with a sharp, pink blush on her face, and a queer, sardonic laugh in her eyes and on her twisted mouth.</p>
<p>"That's the first time I've heard that I was going to Canada," she said.</p>
<p>"Well, you have to hear it for the first time, haven't you?" said the boy.</p>
<p>"Yes, I suppose I have," she said nonchalantly. And she went back to her sewing.</p>
<p>"You're quite ready, are you, to go to Canada? Are you, Nellie?" asked Banford.</p>
<p>March looked up again. She let her shoulders go slack, and let her hand that held the needle lie loose in her lap.</p>
<p>"It depends on how I'm going," she said. "I don't think I want to go jammed up in the steerage, as a soldier's wife. I'm afraid I'm not used to that way."</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-533">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-534">8-G</a><br /></p>
<p>The boy watched her with bright eyes.</p>
<p>"Would you rather stay over here while I go first?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I would, if that's the only alternative," she replied.</p>
<p>"That's much the wisest. Don't make it any fixed engagement," said Banford. "Leave yourself free to go or not after he's got back and found you a place, Nellie. Anything else is madness, madness."</p>
<p>"Don't you think," said the youth, "we ought to get married before I go --- and then go together, or separate, according to how it happens?"</p>
<p>"I think it's a terrible idea," cried Banford.</p>
<p>But the boy was watching March.</p>
<p>"What do you think?" he asked her.</p>
<p>She let her eyes stray vaguely into space.</p>
<p>"Well, I don't know," she said. "I shall have to think about it."</p>
<p>"Why?" he asked pertinently.</p>
<p>"Why?" She repeated his question in a mocking way, and looked at him laughing, though her face was pink again. "I should think there's plenty of reasons why."</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-49">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-50">8-H</a><br /></p>
<p>He watched her in silence. She seemed to have escaped him. She had got into league with Banford against him. There was again the queer, sardonic look about her; she would mock stoically at everything he said or which life offered.</p>
<p>"Of course," he said, "I don't want to press you to do anything you don't wish to do."</p>
<p>"I should think not, indeed," cried Banford indignantly.</p>
<p>At bed-time Banford said plaintively to March:</p>
<p>"You take my hot bottle up for me, Nellie, will you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I'll do it," said March, with the kind of willing unwillingness she so often showed towards her beloved but uncertain Jill.</p>
<p>The two women went upstairs. After a time March called from the top of the stairs: "Good-night, Henry. I shan't be coming down. You'll see to the lamp and the fire, won't you?"</p>

<h3><b>Scene 9<br /><b></b></b></h3>
<p>翌日、ヘンリーは木の下に隠れて、また、ふたりの会話を盗み聞きします。ますます、バンフォードを憎む一方で、その夜にドレスを着ているマーチを見ると、絶対に彼女を自分のものにしたいと思います。</p>

<p><a href="#calibre_link-307">Q9</a><br /></p>
<p>なぜ ヘンリーは突然、大人の責任を感じた（He felt a man, with all a man's grave weight of responsibility.&nbsp;）のでしょうか。（9-I）</p>
<div><br /></div>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-627">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-68">9-A</a><br /></p>
<p>The next day Henry went about with the cloud on his brow and his young cub's face shut up tight. He was cogitating all the time. He had wanted March to marry him and go back to Canada with him. And he had been sure she would do it. Why he wanted her he didn't know. But he did want her. He had set his mind on her. And he was convulsed with a youth's fury at being thwarted. To be thwarted, to be thwarted! It made him so furious inside that he did not know what to do with himself. But he kept himself in hand. Because even now things might turn out differently. She might come over to him. Of course she might. It was her business to do so.</p>
<p>Things drew to a tension again towards evening. He and Banford had avoided each other all day. In fact, Banford went in to the little town by the 11.20 train.&nbsp;<a href="#calibre_link-438">It was market day.</a>&nbsp;She arrived back on the 4.25. Just as the night was falling&nbsp;<a href="#calibre_link-439">Henry saw her little figure in a dark-blue coat and a dark-blue tam-o'-shanter hat crossing the first meadow from the station.</a>&nbsp;He stood under one of the wild pear-trees, with the old dead leaves round his feet. And he watched the little blue figure advancing persistently over the rough winter-ragged meadow. She had her arms full of parcels, and advanced slowly, frail thing she was, but with that devilish little certainty which he so detested in her. He stood invisible under the pear-tree, watching her every step.<a href="#calibre_link-440"> And if looks could have affected her, she would have felt a log of iron on each of her ankles as she made her way forward.</a>&nbsp;"You're a nasty little thing, you are," he was saying softly, across the distance. "You're a nasty little thing. I hope you'll be paid back for all the harm you've done me for nothing. I hope you will --- you nasty little thing. I hope you'll have to pay for it. You will, if wishes are anything. You nasty little creature that you are."</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-184">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-185">9-B</a><br /></p>
<p>She was toiling slowly up the slope. But if she had been slipping back at every step towards the Bottomless Pit, he would not have gone to help her with her parcels.&nbsp;Aha, there went March, striding with her long, land stride in her breeches and her short tunic! Striding down hill at a great pace, and even running a few steps now and then, in her great solicitude and desire to come to the rescue of the little Banford. The boy watched her with rage in his heart. &nbsp;See her leap a ditch, and run, run as if a house was on fire, just to get to that creeping, dark little object down there!&nbsp;So, the Banford just stood still and waited. And March strode up and took all the parcels except a bunch of yellow chrysanthemums. These the Banford still carried --- yellow chrysanthemums!</p>
<p>"Yes, you look well, don't you?" he said softly into the dusk air. "You look well, pottering up there with a bunch of flowers, you do. I'd make you eat them for your tea, if you hug them so tight. And I'd give them you for breakfast again, I would. I'd give you flowers. Nothing but flowers."</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-280">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-281">9-C</a><br /></p>
<p>He watched the progress of the two women. He could hear their voices: March always outspoken and rather scolding in her tenderness, Banford murmuring rather vaguely. They were evidently good friends. He could not hear what they said till they came to the fence of the home meadow, which they must climb. Then he saw March manfully climbing over the bars with all her packages in her arms, and on the still air he heard Banford's fretful:</p>
<p>"Why don't you let me help you with the parcels?" She had a queer, plaintive hitch in her voice. Then came March's robust and reckless:</p>
<p>"Oh, I can manage. Don't you bother about me. You've all you can do to get yourself over."</p>
<p>"Yes, that's all very well," said Banford fretfully. "You say, Don't you bother about me, and then all the while you feel injured because nobody thinks of you."</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-58">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-59">9-D</a><br /></p>
<p>"When do I feel injured?" said March.</p>
<p>"Always. You always feel injured. Now you're feeling injured because I won't have that boy to come and live on the farm."</p>
<p>"I'm not feeling injured at all," said March.</p>
<p>"I know you are. When he's gone you'll sulk over it. I know you will."</p>
<p>"Shall I?" said March. "We'll see."</p>
<p>"Yes, we shall see, unfortunately. I can't think how you can make yourself so cheap. I can't imagine how you can lower yourself like it."</p>
<p>"I haven't lowered myself," said March.</p>
<p>"I don't know what you call it, then. Letting a boy like that come so cheeky and impudent and make a mug of you. I don't know what you think of yourself. How much respect do you think he's going to have for you afterwards?&nbsp;<a href="#calibre_link-60">My word, I wouldn't be in your shoes, if you married him.</a>"</p>
<p>"Of course you wouldn't. My boots are a good bit too big for you, and not half dainty enough," said March, with rather a misfire sarcasm.</p>
<p>"I thought you had too much pride, really I did. A woman's got to hold herself high, especially with a youth like that. Why, he's impudent. Even the way he forced himself on us at the start."</p>
<p>"We asked him to stay," said March.</p>
<p>"Not till he'd almost forced us to. And then he's so cocky and self-assured. My word, he puts my back up. I simply can't imagine how you can let him treat you so cheaply."</p>
<p>"I don't let him treat me cheaply," said March. "Don't you worry yourself, nobody's going to treat me cheaply. And even you aren't, either." She had a tender defiance and a certain fire in her voice.</p>
<p>"Yes, it's sure to come back to me," said Banford bitterly. "That's always the end of it. I believe you only do it to spite me."</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-526">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-527">9-E</a><br /></p>
<p>They went now in silence up the steep, grassy slope and over the brow, through the gorse bushes. On the other side of the hedge the boy followed in the dusk, at some little distance. Now and then, through the huge ancient hedge of hawthorn, risen into trees, he saw the two dark figures creeping up the hill. As he came to the top of the slope he saw the homestead dark in the twilight, with a huge old pear-tree leaning from the near gable, and a little yellow light twinkling in the small side windows of the kitchen. He heard the clink of the latch and saw the kitchen door open into light as the two women went indoors. So they were at home.</p>
<p>And so! --- this was what they thought of him. It was rather in his nature to be a listener, so he was not at all surprised whatever he heard. The things people said about him always missed him personally. He was only rather surprised at the women's way with one another. And he disliked the Banford with an acid dislike. And he felt drawn to the March again. He felt again irresistibly drawn to her. He felt there was a secret bond, a secret thread between him and her, something very exclusive, which shut out everybody else and made him and her possess each other in secret.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-171">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-172">9-F</a><br /></p>
<p>He hoped again that she would have him. He hoped with his blood suddenly firing up that she would agree to marry him quite quickly: at Christmas, very likely. Christmas was not far off. He wanted, whatever else happened, to snatch her into a hasty marriage and a consummation with him. Then for the future, they could arrange later. But he hoped it would happen as he wanted it. He hoped that to-night she would stay a little while with him, after Banford had gone upstairs. He hoped he could touch her soft, creamy cheek, her strange, frightened face. He hoped he could look into her dilated, frightened dark eyes, quite near. He hoped he might even put his hand on her bosom and feel her soft breasts under her tunic. His heart beat deep and powerful as he thought of that. He wanted very much to do so. He wanted to make sure of her soft woman's breasts under her tunic. She always kept the brown linen coat buttoned so close up to her throat. It seemed to him like some perilous secret, that her soft woman's breasts must be buttoned up in that uniform. It seemed to him, moreover, that they were so much softer, tenderer, more lovely and lovable, shut up in that tunic, than were the Banford's breasts, under her soft blouses and chiffon dresses. The Banford would have little iron breasts, he said to himself. For all her frailty and fretfulness and delicacy, she would have tiny iron breasts. But March, under her crude, fast, workman's tunic, would have soft, white breasts, white and unseen. So he told himself, and his blood burned.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-380">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-77">9-G</a><br /></p>
<p>When he went into tea, he had a surprise. He appeared at the inner door, his face very ruddy and vivid and his blue eyes shining, dropping his head forward as he came in, in his usual way, and hesitating in the doorway to watch the inside of the room, keenly and cautiously, before he entered. He was wearing a long-sleeved waistcoat.&nbsp;<a href="#calibre_link-381">His face seemed extraordinarily like a piece of the out-of-doors come indoors: as holly-berries do</a>. In his second of pause in the doorway he took in the two women sitting at table, at opposite ends, saw them sharply. And to his amazement March was dressed in a dress of dull, green silk crape. His mouth came open in surprise. If she had suddenly grown a moustache he could not have been more surprised.</p>
<p>"Why," he said, "do you wear a dress, then?"</p>
<p>She looked up, flushing a deep rose colour, and twisting her mouth with a smile, said:</p>
<p>"Of course I do. What else do you expect me to wear, but a dress?"</p>
<p>"A land girl's uniform, of course," said he.</p>
<p>"Oh," she cried, nonchalant, "that's only for this dirty, mucky work about here."</p>
<p>"Isn't it your proper dress, then?" he said.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-607">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-608">9-H</a><br /></p>
<p>"No, not indoors it isn't," she said. But she was blushing all the time as she poured out his tea. He sat down in his chair at table, unable to take his eyes off her. Her dress was a perfectly simple slip of bluey-green crape, with a line of gold stitching round the top and round the sleeves, which came to the elbow. It was cut just plain and round at the top, and showed her white, soft throat. Her arms he knew, strong and firm muscled, for he had often seen her with her sleeves rolled up. But he looked her up and down, up and down.</p>
<p>Banford, at the other end of the table, said not a word, but piggled with the sardine on her plate. He had forgotten her existence. He just simply stared at March, while he ate his bread and margarine in huge mouthfuls, forgetting even his tea.</p>
<p>"Well, I never knew anything make such a difference!" he murmured, across his mouthfuls.</p>
<p>"Oh, goodness!" cried March, blushing still more. "I might be a pink monkey!"</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-158">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-159">9-I</a><br /></p>
<p>And she rose quickly to her feet and took the tea-pot to the fire, to the kettle. And as she crouched on the hearth with her green slip about her, the boy stared more wide-eyed than ever. Through the crape her woman's form seemed soft and womanly. And when she stood up and walked he saw her legs move soft within her modernly short skirt. She had on black silk stockings, and small patent shoes with little gold buckles.</p>
<p>No, she was another being. She was something quite different. Seeing her always in the hard-cloth breeches, wide on the hips, buttoned on the knee, strong as armour, and in the brown puttees and thick boots, it had never occurred to him that she had a woman's legs and feet. Now it came upon him. She had a woman's soft, skirted legs, and she was accessible. He blushed to the roots of his hair, shoved his nose in his tea-cup and drank his tea with a little noise that made Banford simply squirm: and strangely, suddenly he felt a man, no longer a youth. He felt a man, with all a man's grave weight of responsibility. A curious quietness and gravity came over his soul. He felt a man, quiet, with a little of the heaviness of male destiny upon him.</p>
<p>She was soft and accessible in her dress. The thought went home in him like an everlasting responsibility.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-515">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-516">9-J</a><br /></p>
<p>&nbsp;"Oh, for goodness" sake, say something, somebody," cried Banford fretfully. "It might be a funeral." The boy looked at her, and she could not bear his face.</p>
<p>"A funeral!" said March, with a twisted smile. "Why, that breaks my dream."</p>
<p>Suddenly she had thought of Banford in the wood-box for a coffin.</p>
<p>"What, have you been dreaming of a wedding?" said Banford sarcastically.</p>
<p>"Must have been," said March.</p>
<p>"Whose wedding?" asked the boy.</p>
<p>"I can't remember," said March.</p>
<p>She was shy and rather awkward that evening, in spite of the fact that, wearing a dress, her bearing was much more subdued than in her uniform. She felt unpeeled and rather exposed. She felt almost improper.</p>
</div>

<p>＊＊＊＊＊＊</p>
<p><a href="#calibre_link-480">Q10</a><br /></p>
<p>なぜヘンリーは「バンフォードの顔つきは悪魔のようだ（Evil he thought her look was）」と思ったのでしょうか。（10-L）</p>
<div><br /></div>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-694">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-695">10-A</a><br /></p>
<p>They talked desultorily about Henry's departure next morning, and made the trivial arrangement. But of the matter on their minds, none of them spoke. They were rather quiet and friendly this evening; Banford had practically nothing to say. But inside herself she seemed still, perhaps kindly.</p>
<p>At nine o'clock March brought in the tray with the everlasting tea and a little cold meat which Banford had managed to procure. It was the last supper, so Banford did not want to be disagreeable. She felt a bit sorry for the boy, and felt she must be as nice as she could.</p>
<p>He wanted her to go to bed. She was usually the first. But she sat on in her chair under the lamp, glancing at her book now and then, and staring into the fire. A deep silence had come into the room. It was broken by March asking, in a rather small tone:</p>
<p>"What time is it, Jill?"</p>
<p>"Five past ten," said Banford, looking at her wrist.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-678">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-679">10-B</a><br /></p>
<p>And then not a sound. The boy had looked up from the book he was holding between his knees. His rather wide, cat-shaped face had its obstinate look, his eyes were watchful.</p>
<p>"What about bed?" said March at last.</p>
<p>"I'm ready when you are," said Banford.</p>
<p>"Oh, very well," said March. "I'll fill your bottle."</p>
<p>She was as good as her word. When the hot-water bottle was ready, she lit a candle and went upstairs with it. Banford remained in her chair, listening acutely. March came downstairs again.</p>
<p>"There you are, then," she said. "Are you going up?"</p>
<p>"Yes, in a minute," said Banford. But the minute passed, and she sat on in her chair under the lamp.</p>
<p>Henry, whose eyes were shining like a cat's as he watched from under his brows, and whose face seemed wider, more chubbed and cat-like with unalterable obstinacy, now rose to his feet to try his throw.</p>
<p>"I think I'll go and look if I can see the she-fox," he said. "She may be creeping round. Won't you come as well for a minute, Nellie, and see if we see anything?"</p>
<p>"Me!" cried March, looking up with her startled, wondering face.</p>
<p>"Yes. Come on," he said. It was wonderful how soft and warm and coaxing his voice could be, how near. The very sound of it made Banford's blood boil. "Come on for a minute," he said, looking down into her uplifted, unsure face.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-517">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-518">10-C</a><br /></p>
<p>And she rose to her feet as if drawn up by his young, ruddy face that was looking down on her.</p>
<p>"I should think you're never going out at this time of night, Nellie!" cried Banford.</p>
<p>"Yes, just for a minute," said the boy, looking round on her, and speaking with an odd, sharp yelp in his voice.</p>
<p>March looked from one to the other, as if confused, vague. Banford rose to her feet for battle.</p>
<p>"Why, it's ridiculous. It's bitter cold. You'll catch your death in that thin frock. And in those slippers. You're not going to do any such thing."</p>
<p>There was a moment's pause. Banford turtled up like a little fighting cock, facing March and the boy.</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't think you need worry yourself," he replied. "A moment under the stars won't do anybody any damage. I'll get the rug off the sofa in the dining-room. You're coming, Nellie."</p>
<p>His voice had so much anger and contempt and fury in it as he spoke to Banford: and so much tenderness and proud authority as he spoke to March, that the latter answered:</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm coming."</p>
<p>And she turned with him to the door.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-591">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-592">10-D</a><br /></p>
<p>Banford, standing there in the middle of the room, suddenly burst into a long wail and a spasm of sobs. She covered her face with her poor, thin hands, and her thin shoulders shook in an agony of weeping. March looked back from the door.</p>
<p>"Jill!" she cried in a frantic tone, like someone just coming awake. And she seemed to start towards her darling.</p>
<p>But the boy had March's arm in his grip, and she could not move. She did not know why she could not move. It was as in a dream when the heart strains and the body cannot stir.</p>
<p>"Never mind," said the boy softly. "Let her cry. Let her cry. She will have to cry sooner or later. And the tears will relieve her feelings. They will do her good."</p>
<p>So he drew March slowly through the doorway. But her last look was back to the poor little figure which stood in the middle of the room with covered face and thin shoulders shaken with bitter weeping.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-36">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-37">10-E</a><br /></p>
<p>In the dining-room he picked up the rug and said:</p>
<p>"Wrap yourself up in this."</p>
<p>She obeyed --- and they reached the kitchen door, he holding her soft and firm by the arm, though she did not know it. When she saw the night outside she started back.</p>
<p>"I must go back to Jill," she said. "I must! Oh yes, I must."</p>
<p>Her tone sounded final. The boy let go of her and she turned indoors. But he seized her again and arrested her.</p>
<p>"Wait a minute," he said. "Wait a minute. Even if you go, you're not going yet."</p>
<p>"Leave go! Leave go!" she cried. "My place is at Jill's side. Poor little thing, she's sobbing her heart out."</p>
<p>"Yes," said the boy bitterly. "And your heart too, and mine as well."</p>
<p>"Your heart?" said March. He still gripped her and detained her.</p>
<p>"Isn't it as good as her heart?" he said. "Or do you think it's not?"</p>
<p>"Your heart?" she said again, incredulous.</p>
<p>"Yes, mine! Mine! Do you think I haven't got a heart?" And with his hot grasp he took her hand and pressed it under his left breast. "There's my heart," he said, "if you don't believe in it."</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-435">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-377">10-F</a><br /></p>
<p>It was wonder which made her attend. And then she felt the deep, heavy, powerful stroke of his heart, terrible, like something from beyond. It was like something from beyond, something awful from outside, signalling to her. And the signal paralysed her. It beat upon her very soul, and made her helpless. She forgot Jill. She could not think of Jill any more. She could not think of her. That terrible signalling from outside!</p>
<p>The boy put his arm round her waist.</p>
<p>"Come with me," he said gently. "Come and let us say what we've got to say."</p>
<p>And he drew her outside, closed the door. And she went with him darkly down the garden path.&nbsp;<a href="#calibre_link-436">That he should have a beating heart!&nbsp;</a>And that he should have his arm round her, outside the blanket! She was too confused to think who he was or what he was.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-704">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-705">10-G</a><br /></p>
<p>He took her to a dark corner of the shed, where there was a tool-box with a lid, long and low.</p>
<p>"We'll sit here a minute," he said.</p>
<p>And obediently she sat down by his side.</p>
<p>"Give me your hand," he said.</p>
<p>She gave him both her hands, and he held them between his own. He was young, and it made him tremble.</p>
<p>"You'll marry me. You'll marry me before I go back, won't you?" he pleaded.</p>
<p>"Why, aren't we both a pair of fools?" she said.</p>
<p>He had put her in the corner, so that she should not look out and see the lighted window of the house, across the dark yard and garden. He tried to keep her all there inside the shed with him.</p>
<p>"In what way a pair of fools?" he said. "If you go back to Canada with me, I've got a job and a good wage waiting for me, and it's a nice place, near the mountains. Why shouldn't you marry me? Why shouldn't we marry? I should like to have you there with me. I should like to feel I'd got somebody there, at the back of me, all my life."</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-162">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-163">10-H</a><br /></p>
<p>"You'd easily find somebody else who'd suit you better," she said.</p>
<p>"Yes, I might easily find another girl. I know I could. But not one I really wanted. I've never met one I really wanted for good. You see, I'm thinking of all my life. If I marry, I want to feel it's for all my life. Other girls: well, they're just girls, nice enough to go a walk with now and then. Nice enough for a bit of play. But when I think of my life, then I should be very sorry to have to marry one of them, I should indeed."</p>
<p>"You mean they wouldn't make you a good wife."</p>
<p>"Yes, I mean that. But I don't mean they wouldn't do their duty by me. I mean --- I don't know what I mean. Only when I think of my life, and of you, then the two things go together."</p>
<p>"And what if they didn't?" she said, with her odd, sardonic touch.</p>
<p>"Well, I think they would."</p>
<p>They sat for some time silent. He held her hands in his, but he did not make love to her. Since he had realised that she was a woman, and vulnerable, accessible, a certain heaviness had possessed his soul. He did not want to make love to her. He shrank from any such performance, almost with fear. She was a woman, and vulnerable, accessible to him finally, and he held back from that which was ahead, almost with dread. It was a kind of darkness he knew he would enter finally, but of which he did not want as yet even to think. She was the woman, and he was responsible for the strange vulnerability he had suddenly realised in her.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-343">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-344">10-I</a><br /></p>
<p>"No," she said at last, "I'm a fool. I know I'm a fool."</p>
<p>"What for?" he asked.</p>
<p>"To go on with this business."</p>
<p>"Do you mean me?" he asked.</p>
<p>"No, I mean myself. I'm making a fool of myself, and a big one."</p>
<p>"Why, because you don't want to marry me, really?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't know whether I'm against it, as a matter of fact. That's just it. I don't know."</p>
<p>He looked at her in the darkness, puzzled. He did not in the least know what she meant.</p>
<p>"And don't you know whether you like to sit here with me this minute, or not?" he asked.</p>
<p>"No, I don't really. I don't know whether I wish I was somewhere else, or whether I like being here. I don't know, really."</p>
<p>"Do you wish you were with Miss Banford? Do you wish you'd gone to bed with her?" he asked, as a challenge.</p>
<p>She waited a long time before she answered:</p>
<p>"No," she said at last. "I don't wish that."</p>
<p>"And do you think you would spend all your life with her --- when your hair goes white, and you are old?" he said.</p>
<p>"No," she said, without much hesitation. "I don't see Jill and me two old women together."</p>
<p>"And don't you think, when I'm an old man and you're an old woman, we might be together still, as we are now?" he said.</p>
<p>"Well, not as we are now," she replied. "But I could imagine --- no, I can't. I can't imagine you an old man. Besides, it's dreadful!"</p>
<p>"What, to be an old man?"</p>
<p>"Yes, of course."</p>
<p>"Not when the time comes," he said. "But it hasn't come. Only it will. And when it does, I should like to think you'd be there as well."</p>
<p>"Sort of old age pensions," she said dryly.</p>
<p>Her kind of witless humour always startled him. He never knew what she meant. Probably she didn't quite know herself.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-621">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-622">10-J</a><br /></p>
<p>"No," he said, hurt.</p>
<p>"I don't know why you harp on old age," she said. "I'm not ninety."</p>
<p>"Did anybody ever say you were?" he asked, offended.</p>
<p>They were silent for some time, pulling different ways in the silence.</p>
<p>"I don't want you to make fun of me," he said.</p>
<p>"Don't you?" she replied, enigmatic.</p>
<p>"No, because just this minute I'm serious. And when I'm serious, I believe in not making fun of it."</p>
<p>"You mean nobody else must make fun of you," she replied.</p>
<p>"Yes, I mean that. And I mean I don't believe in making fun of it myself. When it comes over me so that I'm serious, then --- there it is, I don't want it to be laughed at."</p>
<p>She was silent for some time. Then she said, in a vague, almost pained voice:</p>
<p>"No, I'm not laughing at you."</p>
<p><br /></p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-61">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-62">10-K</a><br /></p>
<p>A hot wave rose in his heart.</p>
<p>"You believe me, do you?" he asked.<br /></p>
<p>"Yes, I believe you," she replied, with a twang of her old, tired nonchalance, as if she gave in because she was tired. But he didn't care. His heart was hot and clamorous.<br /></p>
<p>"So you agree to marry me before I go? --- perhaps at Christmas?"<br /></p>
<p>"Yes, I agree."<br /></p>
<p>"There!" he exclaimed. "That's settled it."And he sat silent, unconscious, with all the blood burning in all his veins, like fire in all the branches and twigs of him. He only pressed her two hands to his chest, without knowing. When the curious passion began to die down, he seemed to come awake to the world.<br /></p>
<p>"We'll go in, shall we?" he said: as if he realised it was cold.</p>
<p>She rose without answering.</p>
<p>"Kiss me before we go, now you've said it," he said.</p>
<p>And he kissed her gently on the mouth, with a young, frightened kiss. It made her feel so young, too, and frightened, and wondering: and tired, tired, as if she were going to sleep.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-286">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-287">10-L</a><br /></p>
<p>They went indoors. And in the sitting-room, there, crouched by the fire like a queer little witch, was Banford. She looked round with reddened eyes as they entered, but did not rise. He thought she looked frightening, unnatural, crouching there and looking round at them. Evil he thought her look was, and he crossed his fingers.</p>
<p>Banford saw the ruddy, elate face on the youth: he seemed strangely tall and bright and looming. And March had a delicate look on her face; she wanted to hide her face, to screen it, to let it not be seen.</p>
<p>"You've come at last," said Banford uglily.</p>
<p>"Yes, we've come," said he.</p>
<p>"You've been long enough for anything," she said.</p>
<p>"Yes, we have. We've settled it. We shall marry as soon as possible," he replied.</p>
<p>"Oh, you've settled it, have you! Well, I hope you won't live to repent it," said Banford.</p>
<p>"I hope so too," he replied.</p>
<p>"Are you going to bed now, Nellie?" said Banford.</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm going now."</p>
<p>"Then for goodness" sake come along."<br /></p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-537">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-538">10-M</a><br /></p>
<p>March looked at the boy. He was glancing with his very bright eyes at her and at Banford. March looked at him wistfully. She wished she could stay with him. She wished she had married him already, and it was all over. For oh, she felt suddenly so safe with him. She felt so strangely safe and peaceful in his presence. If only she could sleep in his shelter, and not with Jill. She felt afraid of Jill. In her dim, tender state, it was agony to have to go with Jill and sleep with her. She wanted the boy to save her. She looked again at him.<br /></p>
<p>And he, watching with bright eyes, divined something of what she felt. It puzzled and distressed him that she must go with Jill.</p>
<p>"I shan't forget what you've promised," he said, looking clear into her eyes, right into her eyes, so that he seemed to occupy all her self with his queer, bright look.</p>
<p>She smiled to him, faintly, gently. She felt safe again --- safe with him.</p>

<p>農園を去って9日目に、兵舎にいるヘンリーのところへマーチからの手紙が届きました。予防線をはってきたにもかかわらず、マーチは心変わりをしていました。バンフォードの差し金だ、と激怒したヘンリーは、上官に24時間の休暇願を申請します。</p>

<p>&nbsp;マーチはなぜあのような手紙をヘンリーに書いたのでしょうか。（11-B）</p>

<div id="calibre_link-173">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-174">11-A</a><br /></p>
<p>But in spite of all the boy's precautions, he had a setback.&nbsp;<a href="#calibre_link-69">The morning he was leaving the farm he got March to accompany him to the market-town, about six miles away, where they went to the registrar and had their names stuck up as two people who were going to marry.</a>&nbsp;He was to come at Christmas, and the wedding was to take place then.&nbsp;He hoped in the spring to be able to take March back to Canada with him, now the war was really over. Though he was so young, he had saved some money.</p>
<p>"You never have to be without some money at the back of you, if you can help it," he said.</p>
<p>So she saw him off in the train that was going West:&nbsp;<a href="#calibre_link-175">his camp was on Salisbury Plain.&nbsp;</a>And with big, dark eyes she watched him go, and it seemed as if everything real in life was retreating as the train retreated with his queer, chubby, ruddy face, that seemed so broad across the cheeks, and which never seemed to change its expression, save when a cloud of sulky anger hung on the brow, or the bright eyes fixed themselves in their stare. This was what happened now. He leaned there out of the carriage window as the train drew off, saying good-bye and staring back at her, but his face quite unchanged. There was no emotion on his face. Only his eyes tightened and became fixed and intent in their watching like a cat's when suddenly she sees something and stares. So the boy's eyes stared fixedly as the train drew away, and she was left feeling intensely forlorn. Failing his physical presence, she seemed to have nothing of him. And she had nothing of anything. Only his face was fixed in her mind: the full, ruddy, unchanging cheeks, and the straight snout of a nose and the two eyes staring above. All she could remember was how he suddenly wrinkled his nose, when he laughed, as a puppy does when he is playfully growling. But him, himself, and what he was --- she knew nothing, she had nothing of him when he left her.<br /></p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-382">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-383">11-B</a><br /></p>
<p>On the ninth day after he had left her he received this letter.</p>
<p>"Dear Henry,</p>
<p>I have been over it all again in my mind, this business of me and you, and it seems to me impossible. When you aren't there I see what a fool I am. When you are there you seem to blind me to things as they actually are. You make me see things all unreal, and I don't know what. Then when I am alone again with Jill I seem to come to my own senses and realise what a fool I am making of myself, and how I am treating you unfairly. Because it must be unfair to you for me to go on with this affair when I can't feel in my heart that I really love you. I know people talk a lot of stuff and nonsense about love, and I don't want to do that. I want to keep to plain facts and act in a sensible way. And that seems to me what I'm not doing. I don't see on what grounds I am going to marry you. I know I am not head over heels in love with you, as I have fancied myself to be with fellows when I was a young fool of a girl. You are an absolute stranger to me, and it seems to me you will always be one. So on what grounds am I going to marry you? When I think of Jill, she is ten times more real to me. I know her and I'm awfully fond of her, and I hate myself for a beast if I ever hurt her little finger. We have a life together. And even if it can't last for ever, it is a life while it does last. And it might last as long as either of us lives. Who knows how long we've got to live? She is a delicate little thing, perhaps nobody but me knows how delicate. And as for me, I feel I might fall down the well any day. What I don't seem to see at all is you. When I think of what I've been and what I've done with you, I'm afraid I am a few screws loose. I should be sorry to think that softening of the brain is setting in so soon, but that is what it seems like. You are such an absolute stranger, and so different from what I'm used to, and we don't seem to have a thing in common. As for love, the very word seems impossible. I know what love means even in Jill's case, and I know that in this affair with you it's an absolute impossibility. And then going to Canada. I'm sure I must have been clean off my chump when I promised such a thing. It makes me feel fairly frightened of myself. I feel I might do something really silly that I wasn't responsible for --- and end my days in a lunatic asylum. You may think that's all I'm fit for after the way I've gone on, but it isn't a very nice thought for me. Thank goodness Jill is here, and her being here makes me feel sane again, else I don't know what I might do; I might have an accident with the gun one evening. I love Jill, and she makes me feel safe and sane, with her loving anger against me for being such a fool. Well, what I want to say is, won't you let us cry the whole thing off?&nbsp;I can't marry you, and really, I won't do such a thing if it seems to me wrong. It is all a great mistake. I've made a complete fool of myself, and all I can do is to apologise to you and ask you please to forget it, and please to take no further notice of me. Your fox skin is nearly ready, and seems all right, I will post it to you if you will let me know if this address is still right, and if you will accept my apology for the awful and lunatic way I have behaved with you, and then let the matter rest.</p>
<p>Jill sends her kindest regards. Her mother and father are staying with us over Christmas.</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely,</p>
<p>ELLEN MARCH."</p>

<p><a href="#calibre_link-615">11-C</a><br /></p>
<p>The boy read this letter in camp as he was cleaning his kit. He set his teeth, and for a moment went almost pale, yellow round the eyes with fury. He said nothing and saw nothing and felt nothing but a livid rage that was quite unreasoning. Balked! Balked again! Balked! He wanted the woman, he had fixed like doom upon having her. He felt that was his doom, his destiny, and his reward, to have this woman. She was his heaven and hell on earth, and he would have none elsewhere. Sightless with rage and thwarted madness he got through the morning. Save that in his mind he was lurking and scheming towards an issue, he would have committed some insane act. Deep in himself he felt like roaring and howling and gnashing his teeth and breaking things. But he was too intelligent. He knew society was on top of him, and he must scheme. So with his teeth bitten together, and his nose curiously slightly lifted, like some creature that is vicious, and his eyes fixed and staring, he went through the morning's affairs drunk with anger and suppression. In his mind was one thing --- Banford. He took no heed of all March's outpouring: none. One thorn rankled, stuck in his mind. Banford. In his mind, in his soul, in his whole being, one thorn rankling to insanity. And he would have to get it out. He would have to get the thorn of Banford out of his life, if he died for it.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-195">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-196">11-D</a><br /></p>
<p>With this one fixed idea in his mind, he went to ask for twenty-four hours" leave of absence. He knew it was not due to him. His consciousness was supernaturally keen. He knew where he must go --- he must go to the captain. But how could he get at the captain? In that great camp of wooden huts and tents he had no idea where his captain was.</p>
<p>But he went to the officers" canteen. There was his captain standing talking with three other officers. Henry stood in the doorway at attention.</p>
<p>"May I speak to Captain Berryman?" The captain was Cornish like himself.</p>
<p>"What do you want?" called the captain.</p>
<p>"May I speak to you, Captain?"</p>
<p>"What do you want?" replied the captain, not stirring from among his group of fellow officers.</p>
<p>Henry watched his superior for a minute without speaking.</p>
<p>"You won't refuse me, sir, will you?" he asked gravely.</p>
<p>"It depends what it is."</p>
<p>"Can I have twenty-four hours' leave?"</p>
<p>"No, you've no business to ask."</p>
<p>"I know I haven't. But I must ask you."</p>
<p>"You've had your answer."</p>
<p>"Don't send me away, Captain."</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-278">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-33">11-E</a><br /></p>
<p>There was something strange about the boy as he stood there so everlasting in the doorway. The Cornish captain felt the strangeness at once, and eyed him shrewdly.</p>
<p>"Why, what's afoot?" he said, curious.</p>
<p>"I'm in trouble about something. I must go to Blewbury," said the boy.</p>
<p>"Blewbury, eh? After the girls?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it is a woman, Captain." And the boy, as he stood there with his head reaching forward a little, went suddenly terribly pale, or yellow, and his lips seemed to give off pain. The captain saw and paled a little also. He turned aside.</p>
<p>"Go on, then," he said. "But for God's sake don't cause any trouble of any sort."</p>
<p>"I won't, Captain, thank you."</p>
<p>He was gone.&nbsp;<a href="#calibre_link-279">The captain, upset, took a gin and bitters.</a>&nbsp;Henry managed to hire a bicycle. It was twelve o'clock when he left the camp. He had sixty miles of wet and muddy cross-roads to ride. But he was in the saddle and down the road without a thought of food.</p>

<p>ヘンリーの言ったことば「羽根が傷ついただけか、死んだのか？死んだな！（Was it winged or dead? Dead!）」から、ヘンリーのどんな一面が分かるでしょうか。（12-K）</p>

</div>
<div id="calibre_link-573">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-367">12-A</a><br /></p>
<p>At the farm, March was busy with a work she had had some time in hand.&nbsp;<a href="#calibre_link-322">A bunch of Scotch fir-trees stood at the end of the open shed, on a little bank where ran the fence between two of the gorse-shaggy meadows</a>. The farthest of these trees was dead --- it had died in the summer, and stood with all its needles brown and sere in the air. It was not a very big tree. And it was absolutely dead. So March determined to have it, although they were not allowed to cut any of the timber. But it would make such splendid firing, in these days of scarce fuel.</p>
<p>She had been giving a few stealthy chops at the trunk for a week or more, every now and then hacking away for five minutes, low down, near the ground, so no one should notice. She had not tried the saw, it was such hard work, alone. Now the tree stood with a great yawning gap in his base, perched as it were, on one sinew, and ready to fall. But he did not fall.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-169">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-170">12-B</a><br /></p>
<p>It was late in the damp December afternoon, with cold mists creeping out of the woods and up the hollows, and darkness waiting to sink in from above. There was a bit of yellowness where the sun was fading away beyond the low woods of the distance. March took her axe and went to the tree. The small thud-thud of her blows resounded rather ineffectual about the wintry homestead. Banford came out wearing her thick coat, but with no hat on her head, so that her thin, bobbed hair blew on the uneasy wind that sounded in the pines and in the wood.</p>
<p>"What I'm afraid of," said Banford, "is that it will fall on the shed and we sh'll have another job repairing that."</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't think so," said March, straightening herself and wiping her arm over her hot brow. She was flushed red, her eyes were very wide open and queer, her upper lip lifted away from her two white, front teeth with a curious, almost rabbit-look.</p>
<p>A little stout man in a black overcoat and a bowler hat came pottering across the yard. He had a pink face and a white beard and smallish, pale-blue eyes. He was not very old, but nervy, and he walked with little short steps.</p>
<p>"What do you think, father?" said Banford. "Don't you think it might hit the shed in falling?"</p>
<p>"Shed, no!" said the old man. "Can't hit the shed. Might as well say the fence."</p>
<p>"The fence doesn't matter," said March, in her high voice.</p>
<p>"Wrong as usual, am I!" said Banford, wiping her straying hair from her eyes.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-378">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-379">12-C</a><br /></p>
<p>The tree stood as it were on one spelch of itself, leaning, and creaking in the wind. It grew on the bank of a little dry ditch between the two meadows.&nbsp;<a href="#calibre_link-303">On the top of the bank straggled one fence, running to the bushes uphill. Several trees clustered there in the corner of the field near the shed and near the gate which led into the yard. Towards this gate, horizontal across the weary meadows, came the grassy, rutted approach from the high road.&nbsp;</a>There trailed another rickety fence, long split poles joining the short, thick, wide-apart uprights. The three people stood at the back of the tree, in the corner of the shed meadow, just above the yard gate. The house, with its two gables and its porch, stood tidy in a little grassed garden across the yard. A little, stout, rosy-faced woman in a little red woollen shoulder shawl had come and taken her stand in the porch.</p>
<p>"Isn't it down yet," she cried, in a high little voice.</p>
<p>"Just thinking about it," called her husband. His tone towards the two girls was always rather mocking and satirical. March did not want to go on with her hitting while he was there. As for him, he wouldn't lift a stick from the ground if he could help it, complaining, like his daughter, of rheumatics in his shoulder. So the three stood there a moment silent in the cold afternoon, in the bottom corner near the yard.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-609">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-610">12-D</a><br /></p>
<p>They heard the far-off taps of a gate, and craned to look. Away across, on the green horizontal approach, a figure was just swinging on to a bicycle again, and lurching up and down over the grass, approaching.</p>
<p>"Why, it's one of our boys --- it's Jack," said the old man.</p>
<p>"Can't be," said Banford.</p>
<p>March craned her head to look. She alone recognized the khaki figure. She flushed, but said nothing.</p>
<p>"No, it isn't Jack, I don't think," said the old man, staring with little round blue eyes under his white lashes.</p>
<p>In another moment the bicycle lurched into sight, and the rider dropped off at the gate. It was Henry, his face wet and red and spotted with mud. He was altogether a muddy sight.</p>
<p>"Oh!" cried Banford, as if afraid. "Why, it's Henry!"</p>
<p>"What?" muttered the old man. He had a thick, rapid, muttering way of speaking, and was slightly deaf. "What? What? Who is it? Who is it, do you say? That young fellow? That young fellow of Nellie's? Oh! Oh!" And the satiric smile came on his pink face and white eyelashes.</p>

<p>Henry, pushing the wet hair off his steaming brow, had caught sight of them and heard what the old man said. His hot, young face seemed to flame in the cold light.</p>
<p>"Oh, are you all there!" he said, giving his sudden, puppy's little laugh. He was so hot and dazed with cycling he hardly knew where he was. He leaned the bicycle against the fence and climbed over into the corner on to the bank, without going into the yard.</p>
<p>"Well, I must say, we weren't expecting you," said Banford laconically.</p>
<p>"No, I suppose not," said he, looking at March.</p>
<p>She stood aside, slack, with one knee drooped and the axe resting its head loosely on the ground. Her eyes were wide and vacant, and her upper lip lifted from her teeth in that helpless, fascinated rabbit-look. The moment she saw his glowing, red face it was all over with her. She was as helpless as if she had been bound. The moment she saw the way his head seemed to reach forward.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-577">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-578">12-F</a><br /></p>
<p>"Well, who is it? Who is it, anyway?" asked the smiling, satiric old man in his muttering voice.</p>
<p>"Why, Mr Grenfel, whom you've heard us tell about, father," said Banford coldly.</p>
<p>"Heard you tell about, I should think so. Heard of nothing else practically," muttered the elderly man, with his queer little jeering smile on his face. "How do you do," he added, suddenly reaching out his hand to Henry.</p>
<p>The boy shook hands just as startled. Then the two men fell apart.</p>
<p>"Cycled over from Salisbury Plain, have you?" asked the old man.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Hm! Longish ride. How long d'it take you, eh? Some time, eh? Several hours, I suppose."</p>
<p>"About four."</p>
<p>"Eh? Four! Yes, I should have thought so. When are you going back, then?"</p>
<p>"I've got till to-morrow evening."</p>
<p>"Till to-morrow evening, eh? Yes. Hm! Girls weren't expecting you, were they?"</p>
<p>And the old man turned his pale-blue, round little eyes under their white lashes mockingly towards the girls. Henry also looked round. He had become a little awkward. He looked at March, who was still staring away into the distance as if to see where the cattle were. Her hand was on the pommel of the axe, whose head rested loosely on the ground.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-10">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-11">12-G</a><br /></p>
<p>"What were you doing there?" he asked in his soft, courteous voice. "Cutting a tree down?"</p>
<p>March seemed not to hear, as if in a trance.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Banford. "We've been at it for over a week."</p>
<p>"Oh! And have you done it all by yourselves then?"</p>
<p>"Nellie's done it all, I've done nothing," said Banford.</p>
<p>"Really! You must have worked quite hard," he said, addressing himself in a curious gentle tone direct to March. She did not answer, but remained half averted staring away towards the woods above as if in a trance.</p>
<p>"Nellie!" cried Banford sharply. "Can't you answer?"</p>
<p>"What --- me?" cried March, starting round, and looking from one to the other. "Did anyone speak to me?"</p>
<p>"Dreaming!" muttered the old man, turning aside to smile. "Must be in love, eh, dreaming in the day-time!"</p>
<p>"Did you say anything to me?" said March, looking at the boy as from a strange distance, her eyes wide and doubtful, her face delicately flushed.</p>
<p>"I said you must have worked hard at the tree," he replied courteously.</p>
<p>"Oh, that! Bit by bit. I thought it would have come down by now."</p>
<p>"I'm thankful it hasn't come down in the night, to frighten us to death," said Banford.</p>
<p>"Let me just finish it for you, shall I?" said the boy.</p>
<p>March slanted the axe-shaft in his direction.</p>
<p>"Would you like to?" she said.</p>
<p>"Yes, if you wish it," he said.</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm thankful when the thing's down, that's all," she replied, nonchalant.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-292">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-260">12-H</a><br /></p>
<p>"Which way is it going to fall?" said Banford. "Will it hit the shed?"</p>
<p>"No, it won't hit the shed," he said. "I should think it will fall there --- quite clear. Though it might give a twist and catch the fence."</p>
<p>"Catch the fence!" cried the old man. "What, catch the fence! When it's leaning at that angle? Why, it's further off than the shed. It won't catch the fence."</p>
<p>"No," said Henry, "I don't suppose it will. It has plenty of room to fall quite clear, and I suppose it will fall clear."</p>
<p>"Won't tumble backwards on top of us, will it?" asked the old man, sarcastic.</p>
<p>"No, it won't do that," said Henry, taking off his short overcoat and his tunic. "Ducks! Ducks! Go back!"</p>
<p><a href="#calibre_link-293">A line of four brown-speckled ducks led by a brown-and-green drake were stemming away downhill from the upper meadow, coming like boats running on a ruffled sea, cockling their way top speed downwards towards the fence and towards the little group of people, and cackling as excitedly as if they brought news of the Spanish Armada.</a><br /></p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-433">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-434">12-I</a><br /></p>
<p>"Silly things! Silly things!" cried Banford, going forward to turn them off. But they came eagerly towards her, opening their yellow-green beaks and quacking as if they were so excited to say something.</p>
<p>"There's no food. There's nothing here. You must wait a bit," said Banford to them. "Go away. Go away. Go round to the yard."</p>
<p>They didn't go, so she climbed the fence to swerve them round under the gate and into the yard. So off they waggled in an excited string once more, wagging their rumps like the stems of little gondolas, ducking under the bar of the gate. Banford stood on the top of the bank, just over the fence, looking down on the other three.</p>
<p>Henry looked up at her, and met her queer, round-pupilled, weak eyes staring behind her spectacles. He was perfectly still. He looked away, up at the weak, leaning tree. And as he looked into the sky, like a huntsman who is watching a flying bird, he thought to himself: "If the tree falls in just such a way, and spins just so much as it falls, then the branch there will strike her exactly as she stands on top of that bank."</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-662">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-663">12-J</a><br /></p>
<p>He looked at her again. She was wiping the hair from her brow again, with that perpetual gesture. In his heart he had decided her death. A terrible still force seemed in him, and a power that was just his. If he turned even a hair's breadth in the wrong direction, he would lose the power.</p>
<p>"Mind yourself, Miss Banford," he said. And his heart held perfectly still, in the terrible pure will that she should not move.</p>
<p>"Who, me, mind myself?" she cried, her father's jeering tone in her voice. "Why, do you think you might hit me with the axe?"</p>
<p>"No, it's just possible the tree might, though," he answered soberly. But the tone of his voice seemed to her to imply that he was only being falsely solicitous, and trying to make her move because it was his will to move her.</p>
<p>"Absolutely impossible," she said.</p>
<p>He heard her. But he held himself icy still, lest he should lose his power.</p>
<p>"No, it's just possible. You'd better come down this way."</p>
<p>"Oh, all right. Let us see some crack Canadian tree felling," she retorted.</p>
<p>"Ready, then," he said, taking the axe, looking round to see he was clear.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-118">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-119">12-K</a><br /></p>
<p>There was a moment of pure, motionless suspense, when the world seemed to stand still. Then suddenly his form seemed to flash up enormously tall and fearful, he gave two swift, flashing blows, in immediate succession, the tree was severed, turning slowly, spinning strangely in the air and coming down like a sudden darkness on the earth. No one saw what was happening except himself. No one heard the strange little cry which the Banford gave as the dark end of the bough swooped down, down on her. No one saw her crouch a little and receive the blow on the back of the neck. No one saw her flung outwards and laid, a little twitching heap, at the foot of the fence. No one except the boy. And he watched with intense bright eyes, as he would watch a wild goose he had shot. Was it winged or dead? Dead!</p>
<p>Immediately he gave a loud cry. Immediately March gave a wild shriek that went far, far down the afternoon. And the father started a strange bellowing sound.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-674">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-675">12-L</a><br /></p>
<p>The boy leapt the fence and ran to the figure. The back of the neck and head was a mass of blood, of horror. He turned it over. The body was quivering with little convulsions. But she was dead really. He knew it, that it was so. He knew it in his soul and his blood. The inner necessity of his life was fulfilling itself, it was he who was to live. The thorn was drawn out of his bowels. So he put her down gently. She was dead.</p>
<p>He stood up. March was standing there petrified and absolutely motionless. Her face was dead white, her eyes big black pools. The old man was scrambling horribly over the fence.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid it's killed her," said the boy.</p>
<p>The old man was making curious, blubbering noises as he huddled over the fence. "What!" cried March, starting electric.</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm afraid," repeated the boy.</p>
<p>March was coming forward. The boy was over the fence before she reached it.</p>
<p>"What do you say, killed her?" she asked in a sharp voice.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid so," he answered softly.</p>
<p>She went still whiter, fearful. The two stood facing one another. Her black eyes gazed on him with the last look of resistance. And then in a last agonized failure she began to grizzle, to cry in a shivery little fashion of a child that doesn't want to cry, but which is beaten from within, and gives that little first shudder of sobbing which is not yet weeping, dry and fearful.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-737">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-738">12-M</a><br /></p>
<p>He had won. She stood there absolutely helpless, shuddering her dry sobs and her mouth trembling rapidly. And then, as in a child, with a little crash came the tears and the blind agony of sightless weeping. She sank down on the grass, and sat there with her hands on her breast and her face lifted in sightless, convulsed weeping. He stood above her, looking down on her, mute, pale, and everlasting seeming. He never moved, but looked down on her. And among all the torture of the scene, the torture of his own heart and bowels, he was glad, he had won.</p>
<p>After a long time he stooped to her and took her hands.</p>
<p>"Don't cry," he said softly. "Don't cry."</p>
<p>She looked up at him with tears running from her eyes, a senseless look of helplessness and submission. So she gazed on him as if sightless, yet looking up to him. She would never leave him again. He had won her. And he knew it and was glad, because he wanted her for his life. His life must have her. And now he had won her. It was what his life must have.</p>

<p>「幸福をはきちがえている（The awful mistake of happiness.）」とありますが、ロレンスの幸福観とはどういうものでしょうか。（13-D）<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-190">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-191">13-A</a><br /></p>
<p>But if he had won her, he had not yet got her. They were married at Christmas as he had planned, and he got again ten days leave. They went to Cornwall, to his own village, on the sea. He realised that it was awful for her to be at the farm any more.</p>
<p>But though she belonged to him, though she lived in his shadow, as if she could not be away from him, she was not happy. She did not want to leave him: and yet she did not feel free with him. Everything around her seemed to watch her, seemed to press on her. He had won her, he had her with him, she was his wife. And she --- she belonged to him, she knew it. But she was not glad. And he was still foiled. He realised that though he was married to her and possessed her in every possible way, apparently, and though she wanted him to possess her, she wanted it, she wanted nothing else, now, still he did not quite succeed.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-429">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-430">13-B</a><br /></p>
<p>Something was missing. Instead of her soul swaying with new life, it seemed to droop, to bleed, as if it were wounded. She would sit for a long time with her hand in his, looking away at the sea. And in her dark, vacant eyes was a sort of wound, and her face looked a little peaked. If he spoke to her, she would turn to him with a faint new smile, the strange, quivering little smile of a woman who has died in the old way of love, and can't quite rise to the new way. She still felt she ought to do something, to strain herself in some direction. And there was nothing to do, and no direction in which to strain herself. And she could not quite accept the submergence which his new love put upon her. If she was in love, she ought to exert herself, in some way, loving. She felt the weary need of our day to exert herself in love. But she knew that in fact she must no more exert herself in love. He would not have the love which exerted itself towards him. It made his brow go black. No, he wouldn't let her exert her love towards him. No, she had to be passive, to acquiesce, and to be submerged under the surface of love. She had to be like the seaweeds she saw as she peered down from the boat, swaying forever delicately under water, with all their delicate fibrils put tenderly out upon the flood, sensitive, utterly sensitive and receptive within the shadowy sea, and never, never rising and looking forth above water while they lived. Never. Never looking forth from the water until they died, only then washing, corpses, upon the surface. But while they lived, always submerged, always beneath the wave. Beneath the wave they might have powerful roots, stronger than iron; they might be tenacious and dangerous in their soft waving within the flood. Beneath the water they might be stronger, more indestructible than resistant oak trees are on land. But it was always under-water, always under-water. And she, being a woman, must be like that.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-145">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-146">13-C</a><br /></p>
<p>And she had been so used to the very opposite. She had had to take all the thought for love and for life, and all the responsibility. Day after day she had been responsible for the coming day, for the coming year: for her dear Jill's health and happiness and well-being. Verily, in her own small way, she had felt herself responsible for the well-being of the world. And this had been her great stimulant, this grand feeling that, in her own small sphere, she was responsible for the well-being of the world.</p>
<p>And she had failed. She knew that, even in her small way, she had failed. She had failed to satisfy her own feeling of responsibility. It was so difficult. It seemed so grand and easy at first. And the more you tried, the more difficult it became. It had seemed so easy to make one beloved creature happy. And the more you tried, the worse the failure. It was terrible. She had been all her life reaching, reaching, and what she reached for seemed so near, until she had stretched to her utmost limit. And then it was always beyond her.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-504">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-505">13-D</a><br /></p>
<p>Always beyond her, vaguely, unrealizably beyond her, and she was left with nothingness at last. The life she reached for, the happiness she reached for, the well-being she reached for all slipped back, became unreal, the further she stretched her hand. She wanted some goal, some finality --- and there was none. Always this ghastly reaching, reaching, striving for something that might be just beyond. Even to make Jill happy. She was glad Jill was dead. For she had realised that she could never make her happy. Jill would always be fretting herself thinner and thinner, weaker and weaker. Her pains grew worse instead of less. It would be so for ever. She was glad she was dead.</p>
<p>And if Jill had married a man it would have been just the same. The woman striving, striving to make the man happy, striving within her own limits for the well-being of her world. And always achieving failure. Little, foolish successes in money or in ambition. But at the very point where she most wanted success, in the anguished effort to make some one beloved human being happy and perfect, there the failure was almost catastrophic. You wanted to make your beloved happy, and his happiness seemed always achievable. If only you did just this, that and the other. And you did this, that, and the other, in all good faith, and every time the failure became a little more ghastly. You could love yourself to ribbons and strive and strain yourself to the bone, and things would go from bad to worse, bad to worse, as far as happiness went. The awful mistake of happiness.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-564">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-565">13-E</a><br /></p>
<p>Poor March, in her good-will and her responsibility, she had strained herself till it seemed to her that the whole of life and everything was only a horrible abyss of nothingness. The more you reached after the fatal flower of happiness, which trembles so blue and lovely in a crevice just beyond your grasp, the more fearfully you become aware of the ghastly and awful gulf of the precipice below you, into which you will inevitably plunge, as into the bottomless pit, if you reach any further. You pluck flower after flower --- it is never the flower. The flower itself --- its calyx is a horrible gulf, it is the bottomless pit.</p>
<p>That is the whole history of the search for happiness, whether it be your own or somebody else's that you want to win. It ends, and it always ends, in the ghastly sense of the bottomless nothingness into which you will inevitably fall if you strain any further.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-569">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-570">13-F</a><br /></p>
<p>And women? --- what goal can any woman conceive, except happiness? Just happiness, for herself and the whole world. That, and nothing else. And so, she assumes the responsibility, and sets off towards her goal. She can see it there, at the foot of the rainbow. Or she can see it a little way beyond, in the blue distance. Not far, not far.</p>
<p>But the end of the rainbow is a bottomless gulf down which you can fall forever without arriving, and the blue distance is a void pit which can swallow you and all your efforts into its emptiness, and still be no emptier. You and all your efforts. So, the illusion of attainable happiness!</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-670">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-290">13-G</a><br /></p>
<p>Poor March, she had set off so wonderfully towards the blue goal. And the further and further she had gone, the more fearful had become the realisation of emptiness. An agony, an insanity at last.</p>
<p>She was glad it was over. She was glad to sit on the shore and look westwards over the sea, and know the great strain had ended. She would never strain for love and happiness any more. And Jill was safely dead. Poor Jill, poor Jill. It must be sweet to be dead.</p>
<p>For her own part, death was not her destiny. She would have to leave her destiny to the boy. But then, the boy. He wanted more than that. He wanted her to give herself without defences, to sink and become submerged in him. And she --- she wanted to sit still, like a woman on&nbsp;<a href="#calibre_link-388">the last milestone</a>, and watch. She wanted to see, to know, to understand. She wanted to be alone: with him at her side.</p>
<p>And he! He did not want her to watch any more, to see any more, to understand any more.&nbsp;<a href="#calibre_link-389">He wanted to veil her woman's spirit, as Orientals veil the woman's face. He wanted her to commit herself to him, and to put her independent spirit to sleep. He wanted to take away from her all her effort, all that seemed her very raison d'etre.&nbsp;</a>He wanted to make her submit, yield, blindly pass away out of all her strenuous consciousness. He wanted to take away her consciousness, and make her just his woman. Just his woman.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-215">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-216">13-H</a><br /></p>
<p>And she was so tired, so tired, like a child that wants to go to sleep, but which fights against sleep as if sleep were death. She seemed to stretch her eyes wider in the obstinate effort and tension of keeping awake. She would keep awake. She would know. She would consider and judge and decide. She would have the reins of her own life between her own hands. She would be an independent woman to the last. But she was so tired, so tired of everything. And sleep seemed near. And there was such rest in the boy.</p>
<p>Yet there, sitting in a niche of the high, wild, cliffs of West Cornwall, looking over the westward sea, she stretched her eyes wider and wider. Away to the West, Canada, America. She would &nbsp;know and she would see what was ahead. And the boy, sitting beside her, staring down at the gulls, had a cloud between his brows and the strain of discontent in his eyes. He wanted her asleep, at peace, in him. He wanted her at peace asleep in him. And there she was, dying with the strain of her own wakefulness. Yet she would not sleep: no, never. Sometimes he thought bitterly that he ought to have left her. He ought never to have killed Banford. He should have left Banford and March to kill one another.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-711">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-712">13-I</a><br /></p>
<p>But that was only impatience: and he knew it. He was waiting, waiting to go west. He was aching almost in torment to leave England, to go west, to take March away. To leave this shore! He believed that as they crossed the seas, as they left this England which he so hated, because in some way it seemed to have stung him with poison, she would go to sleep. She would close her eyes at last, and give in to him.</p>
<p>And then he would have her, and he would have his own life at last. He chafed, feeling he hadn't got his own life. He would never have it till she yielded and slept in him. Then he would have all his own life as a young man and a male, and she would have all her own life as a woman and a female. There would be no more of this awful straining. She would not be a man any more, an independent woman with a man's responsibility. Nay, even the responsibility for her own soul she would have to commit to him. He knew it was so, and obstinately held out against her, waiting for the surrender.</p>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-721">
<p><a href="#calibre_link-722">13-J</a><br /></p>
<p>"You'll feel better when once we get over the seas to Canada over there," he said to her as they sat among the rocks on the cliff.</p>
<p>She looked away to the sea's horizon, as if it were not real. Then she looked round at him, with the strained, strange look of a child that is struggling against sleep.</p>
<p>"Shall I?" she said.</p>
<p>"Yes," he answered quietly.</p>
<p>And her eyelids dropped with the slow motion, sleep weighing them unconscious. But she pulled them open again to say:</p>
<p>"Yes, I may. I can't tell. I can't tell what it will be like over there."</p>
<p>"If only we could go soon!" he said, with pain in his voice.</p>

<div>ヴィクトリア女王</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>ヨーロッパ大陸の西に位置する島国イギリスは、16世紀頃より、強国スペイン、フランスとの闘いに勝利し、世界各地に勢力を伸ばし、各地に植民地を作り、巨万の富を築く超大国「大英帝国」として君臨していました。ロレンスが生まれた1885年は、その最盛期のヴィクトリア女王時代（1837-1901）の後期にあたります。帝国には陰りが見え始めましたが、まだ余勢のある時代でした。</div>

<h4 id="calibre_link-460"><b><b><b>② 「労働者の地位」</b></b></b></h4>
<div>イギリスを「世界の工場」にしたのは18世紀後半から始まった産業革命の成果ですが、これによって裕福な産業資本家と貧しい工場労働者との対立関係ができます。労働者の権利を求める運動が激化した19世紀を経て、20世紀初頭には労働党が結成され（1900年）、1924年には政権を獲得することとなります。現在も労働党、保守党の二大政党は続いています。</div>

<div>産業革命によって新たに台頭してきたのが中産階級です。1832年、最初の選挙法改正によって男性の庶民が国政に参加することができるようになると、財産がない労働者は選挙権を要求して激しい運動を展開します。その結果、1918年には成人男子すべてに選挙権が与えられました。</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>女性は、19世紀の後半から男性と平等の選挙権を求めて運動を行います。1918年には制限がつきながらも、初めて選挙権が与えられ、1928年には成人女子すべてに選挙権が与えられました。</div>

<h4 id="calibre_link-462"><b><b><b>④ 「教育」</b></b></b></h4>
<div>一方、せっかく参政権が拡大しても読み書きのできない人が多数いたため、教育普及が政府の課題となります。1870年には初等教育の義務化がなされ、同様に高等教育もオックスフォード大学、ケンブリッジ大学のほかに、ロンドン大学など他の大学が発足します。</div>

<div>ロレンスは炭鉱夫の息子として生まれましたが、労働者の地位の向上や教育の機会の増大などの恩恵を受けて、現在のノッティンガム大学で学ぶことができました。ロレンス自身、作家になる前には小学校で教えています。なお、女性の高等教育も19世紀の後半から始まりました。</div>

<div>ヴィクトリア時代、人びとはキリスト教を信仰し、キリスト教道徳を守っていました。「博愛」「慈善」「自己犠牲」が大事な徳目でした。労働は神聖で、生活を堕落させるとして禁酒運動が推し進められていました。</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>また、結婚生活は神聖で、姦通は最大の罪悪、性はタブーとなっていたため、「腹」「脚」などの言葉も使うことを避けられました。女性は顔と手以外を他人に見せてはなりませんでした。</div>

<div><b><b>Jill Banford（ジル・バンフォード）</b></b></div>
<div>舞台となるベーリー農園を友人のマーチと購入した三十くらいの女性。小柄でひ弱ですが、人をもてなすことが好きで暖かい性格の持ち主です。実際は、彼女の裕福な父親の援助によって農園を購入したこともあって、農園の経営については支配的なところも垣間見せます。</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><b><b>Nellie March（ネリー・マーチ、愛称ネル）</b></b></div>
<div>バンフォードと共同で農園を経営しますが、農園での仕事の大部分は大柄で筋肉質のマーチが受け持ちます。本来の美しさを農作業用の制服で隠し、男のようにバンフォードを守ります。バンフォードと同じく三十くらいの女性。</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><b><b>Henry Grenfel（ヘンリー・グレンフェル）</b></b></div>
<div>農園に訪れた二十歳そこそこの兵士。以前この農園に住んでいたことがあり、ふたりが住んでいるとは知らず、休暇でふらりとやってきます。</div>
<div><span>	</span></div>
<div>そして<b><b>fox（キツネ）</b></b>の登場です。キツネは農場のニワトリを襲う、女性たちの「敵」です。ところがマーチは、実際にキツネと出会うと、退治するはずがキツネの虜になります。そんなある日、農園に突然現れたヘンリーに、マーチはキツネを重ね合わせます。女性ふたりだけの生活の中に、ひとりの青年が入り込み、共同生活を始める ―― この「三角形」の舞台設定がストーリーに緊迫感を持たせます。</div>

<div><h4><b>② 「時代背景」</b></h4>
<h5 id="calibre_link-468"><b><b><b>A &nbsp;第一次世界大戦</b></b></b></h5>
<div>第一次世界大戦（1914-1918）の終末、1918年12月にロレンスは「キツネ」の執筆を始めました。大戦の終わった翌月で、戦争の雰囲気が色濃く残っていた頃です。</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>一方、この小説の舞台も1918年です。ヘンリーはまだ現役の兵士で、除隊していません。前線から戻ってきたばかりの兵士です。「ハンティング（狩り）」という行為が彼にとっては自然であり、また、それしかできないことがこの小説のポイントのひとつとなります。</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>マーチとバンフォード、女性ふたりで農園を経営する、という設定も、戦争に駆り出された男性に代わって女性が労働力になっていることを示唆しています。実際、大戦中の女性の活躍が評価されて、1918年に制限つきながらはじめて婦人参政権が、1928年には成人女子すべてに選挙権が与えられました。</div>

<div><h3><b>3. イギリスの階級制度と田園風景</b></h3>
<h4 id="calibre_link-472"><b>① 「イギリスの階級制度」</b></h4>
<div>階級制度は18世紀後半、産業革命の影響から生まれます。昔から存在する国王と貴族の上流階級に対して、産業革命で新たに産業界の裕福な中流階級が誕生しました。そして、彼らに使われる労働者階級、この3つの階級制度が経済面だけの区分でなく、生活全般においても人びとを区分する制度となったのが、イギリスの階級制度の特徴です。</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><div>炭坑労働者であるロレンスの父が属したのは、いちばん下と考えられた労働者階級で、肉体労働をする人たちが属します。たとえば、同じ炭坑で働いていても地下にもぐり石炭を掘る人は労働者階級ですが、炭坑で事務などする人は中産階級、といった具合に分けられました。</div>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>実際、イギリスでは今も階級制度が存在します。出身校（パブリックスクール出身かどうか）、言葉遣い（アクセント）、大学進学率等で、その人が属する階級が推察されるほどです。</div>
<div><br /></div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-201">
<div><h4><b>② 「イギリスの田園風景」</b></h4>
<div>イギリスは「丘の国」といってもよいほど、丘陵の多い国です。本書でも、ベーリー農園から見える丘の連なる景色や、生垣によってパッチワークのようにつぎはぎになって見える放牧場の景色の描写がでてきます。日本でいえば、水田の風景が典型的な田園風景とすれば、この生垣と放牧場がイギリスの田園風景と言えます。</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>もともと、イギリスは森林に恵まれた国でしたが、中世になると歴代の国王が収入源として森の木を切って売ったり、土地所有者が森そのものを売ったりして、多くの森林で農地にするため、もしくは造船、鉄・レンガなどの製造に使用される木炭用として伐採が行われてきました。18世紀に産業革命が起こると、建築等の用材として森林伐採は加速しました。</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>そこで20世紀に入ると森林調査管理委員会（the Forestry Commission）が設立され、大規模な植林の実施、本格的な森林の管理が行われるようになりました。物語のなかでも、マーチが伐採を禁止されている枯れ木をこっそりと切り倒そうとする場面（12-A）があります。</div>

<div><br /></div>
<div><div>農業・林業のほかにも、電車の車掌や、兵器、爆弾などの製造員にも女性が進出した。男性並みの賃金がもらえるので女性たちは満足度は高かったが反面、事故死の危険もあった。<br /></div>

<div>マーチの願望を表しています。ロレンスと同年代に活躍したオーストリア人精神科医フロイトによれば、夢は抑圧されている無意識の願望の表れであるとしますが、マーチの場合もこれに当てはまります。</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>マーチの抑圧された願望は結婚願望かと思われます。ヘンリーを一目見た瞬間から、無意識のうちに結婚相手としてみているのではないでしょうか。</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>第一次世界大戦で、適齢期で頑健な男性は戦地へ赴き、イギリス国内には結婚相手が不足している状態でした。バンフォードについては、Scene 1で「結婚しそうにもなかったという理由から」父親が娘に農園経営をするための援助をした、と書かれています。</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>マーチについては、結婚についての記述は書かれていません。ここで、ロレンスは夢を使って、マーチの気持ちを代弁しているのだと思います。</div>

<div>実際には結婚など考えられなかったマーチですが、求婚されたことである種の束縛から解放されたのだと取りました。</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>夢のところでの解説のとおり、マーチには当然ですが結婚願望があり、ヘンリーの若い声を聞いた瞬間から結婚相手と考え、求婚されることを期待していたと考えられます。</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>マーチは、相手の口調、態度などから、求婚されるのはいつかと思い緊張していたことでしょう。ですから、期待通り求婚されてほっとしたと思います。しかし、結婚までいくのかどうかは彼女には分かりません。ヘンリーの本気度を注意深くさぐらなければなりません。</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>そうなると、マーチも立場を変えたhunter でなければなりません。「馬鹿なこと言わないでちょうだい（"Don't try any of your tomfoolery on me."）」というマーチのセリフから、ヘンリーが本気かどうかのテストの始まりです。<br /></div>

<div>サンザシ（hawthorn）の若木を移植する。若木と若木の隙間は10センチメートルほどで、互いの横枝で隠せるくらいの距離に植える。サンザシは成長が早いだけでなく、密に枝葉を伸ばし、頑丈で、とげのある枝を持つという利点から選ばれる。</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><img alt="5B_2" src="images/00016.jpeg" /><br /></div>
<div>次に1メートルほどの間隔で支柱の杭（stake）を打ち、さらに若木を斜めに45度くらいの角度に曲げてからめ（pleaching, plashing）たり、ハシバミ（hazel）やヤナギ（willow）の枝を編み合わせたり、リンボク（blackthorn）やヒイラギ（holly）など、とげの多い灌木も加えたりする。</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><img alt="5B_3" src="images/00027.jpeg" /><br /></div>
<div>サンザシの生垣はthorn hedgeあるいはhawthorn hedgeといい、この生垣のところどころに生えてくるオーク（oak）、トネリコ（ash）、ニレ（elm）、コリヤナギ（withy）、ニワトコ（elder）、野リンゴ（crab apple）、野ナシ（wild pear）、ポッキリヤナギ（crack willow）などの木、あるいはバラ（rose）、スイカズラ（honeysuckle）、ヤマノイモ（black bryony）、センニンソウ（traveller's joy）などがからみつくこともあって、一層堅固な囲いとなる。<br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><img alt="5B_4" src="images/00021.jpeg" /><br /></div>
<div>また、サンザシが十分に育成するように、土地の水はけをよくする目的で、生垣の底部（hedge bottom）に沿って排水溝（drainage ditch）が掘られることもある。そのために生垣のところが高い土手（cam）になっているものも見られる。</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>＜生垣の役目＞</div>
<div>土留めとして土壌の流出を防いだり、家畜や作物を風雨から守ったり、あるいは適度の湿気をも保ち、土地を肥沃にする農業の面のみならず、動植物にとってもきわめて重要な意味を持っている。キツネ（fox）、イタチ（weasel / stoat）、ウサギ（rabbit）、ハリネズミ（hedgehog）などの哺乳類の住みかともなっている。</div>

<div>all the people here はこの村の人たちを指しています。住んでいる場所も、やっている仕事も同じなのに村人を見下した表現でバンフォードが話すのは、自分が「地主」であるという意識が高いからで、おそらく村人は地主の所有している畑で働く小作人（peasant）、日雇い労働者（day laborer）と思われます。だから、村人などと同列に扱ってもらっては困る、ということがこのセリフで表現されているのでしょう。</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>おもしろいのは、村人に対してはバンフォードはマーチを自分と対等の立場で見て話していますが、ふたりの関係でいうと、命令をするのはバンフォードで、農園の仕事のほとんどを請け負っているのがマーチですから、バンフォードにとってマーチは、土地を持たないという意味では村人と同じです。</div>

<div>大きな問題で簡単には答えられませんが、この文脈で言えば、マーチのしたように「善意と責任感」から「幸福」は生まれるものとはいえない、ということでしょう。もちろん「悪意と無責任」からは幸福は生まれません。意図しない、自然な生き方があるのだろう、ということでしょう。</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>たとえば、木が成長することには「善意も責任感」もありません。それでも木は木です。それなりの立派な存在です。人間にもそういう生き方はあるのだろう、ということです。</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>「幸福の青い鳥をさがす」という言葉がありますが、「幸福」とは追うものではないというのがロレンスの言い分です。「幸福」は人間すべての内部にすでにある、というのがロレンスの思想です。木と同じようにそれを育て大きくしていけばよいのです。<br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>もちろん、他人を幸福にしようとすることは間違っていません。ただし他人を幸福にすることだけが「幸福」と考えるのは「幸福をはきちがえている」ということをロレンスはここで言っていると思います。</div>

<p><a href="#calibre_link-46">そのふたりの娘たち</a>は、ふだんバンフォードとマーチという苗字で知られていた。<a href="#calibre_link-47">彼らは共同で農園を買い取り、自分たちだけでその仕事をしようとしていた。ひなを育て、ニワトリとアヒルを飼い、それに加えて、牝牛を1頭、仔牛を1、2頭飼うことで生計を立てようとしていたのである。</a>残念ながら計画はうまくいっていなかった。</p>
<p>バンフォードは眼鏡をかけ、小柄で、やせていて、ひ弱だった。しかし、主に農園に投資したのは彼女であった。マーチには金がほとんどなかったからである。<a href="#calibre_link-48">イズリントン</a>で商売を営むバンフォードの父親は、娘の健康のために農園経営を始めさせたのだが、娘を愛していたこともあるし、結婚しそうにもなかったという理由からでもあった。バンフォードに比べてマーチは丈夫であった。彼女はイズリントンの夜学で大工と建具を学んだ。農園では、彼女が男の役割をすることとなった。それに、バンフォードの年取った祖父も農園を始めた頃は一緒に暮らしていた。祖父はもとから農夫だった。だが、残念なことにベーリー農園に来てから1年で亡くなった。それからはふたりだけになってしまった。</p>

<p>ふたりとも若くはなく、三十に近かった。だが、年を取っているというわけではない。彼らは勇ましく難事業に乗り出した。<a href="#calibre_link-276">農園には黒色レグホン種、白色レグホン種、プリマス種、ワイアンドット種などのニワトリがたくさんいる ―― それにアヒルもいるし、放牧地には2頭の若い牝牛がいた。</a>残念ながら、そのうちの1頭はベーリー農園の囲いのなかにいるのを嫌がった。<a href="#calibre_link-277">マーチがどんなに苦心して柵をつくっても、その牝牛は外に出て森のなかで暴れたり、隣の放牧場に侵入するのである。</a>マーチとバンフォードがその牝牛を追いかけても、逃げ足が速くつかまえられない。万策尽きて、ふたりはこの若い牝牛を売り払ってしまった。そのあと、ちょうどもう1頭の牝牛が初めて仔牛を生む前に、バンフォードの祖父が亡くなった。娘たちは、きたるべき事態を考え、慌ててその牝牛も売り、ニワトリとアヒルの世話だけをすればいいようにした。</p>
<p>少し残念ではあったが、牛がいなくなったことでほっとした。奴隷のように働くばかりが人生ではない。この点では娘たちの意見は一致した。ニワトリとアヒルだけでも結構手がかかったからだ。<a href="#calibre_link-257">マーチは吹き抜け小屋の隅に大工用の工作台を置いた</a>。ここで彼女は、ニワトリにかぶせる籠や戸やほかに必要なものをつくった。<a href="#calibre_link-257">ニワトリには、昔なら納屋や牛小屋として使われていた大きめの建物を小屋としてあてがった。</a>見事な住まいであり、ニワトリたちは大いに満足すべきところである。たしかに満足しているように見えた。しかし、ニワトリたちは奇妙な病気にかかるは、要求が高くて世話が焼けるは、それに卵を生むことを頑として拒否しているはで、ふたりとも嫌気がさしていた。<br /></p>

<p>戸外の仕事のほとんどがマーチの担当だった。<a href="#calibre_link-126">半ズボンをはき、ゲートルをつけ、ベルトつきのコートを着て、だぶついた帽子をかぶって</a>外で働いている時の彼女は、ある種の品があり、ゆったりして均整の取れた青年のように見えた。というのも、彼女は撫で肩ではなかったし、動きは軽々と自信に満ち、超然として皮肉な感じも少しあったからである。しかしその顔は、決して男の顔というものではなかった。彼女が身をかがめると、こまかに縮れた黒髪の房が顔にかかり、ふたたび顔を上げると、その黒い眼は大きく見開いているのだった。驚いたようであり、内気なようであり、ひとを小馬鹿にしたようでもある、奇妙な目つきだった。その口も、苦しんでいるかのように、また、皮肉屋でもあるかのように固く結ばれていた。彼女には何か風変わりで、説明しがたいところがあった。彼女はよく、片方の腰で体のバランスを取るような姿勢で、傾斜している中庭の不快なぬかるみを走りまわるニワトリを見たり、声をかけたらやってくる、贔屓（ひいき）にしている白い牝鶏の名前を呼んだりした。3本指のニワトリの群れがのんびりうろついているのを眺めている時も、マーチの大きな黒い眼は皮肉なきらめきを見せるだけだった。また、親しみを見せようとマーチの長靴をつつく贔屓のパティにかける声にも同じような剣呑（けんのん）な皮肉な調子があった。<br /></p>

<p>マーチの努力にもかかわらず、ベーリー農園での養鶏は成功しなかった。飼育法通りに朝、温めた餌をやるとニワトリたちが数時間、だるく眠たげになることにマーチは気付いた。のんびりと消化している間に、彼らが小屋の柱にもたれかかっている姿を予想できた。卵を生むなら、せっせとひっかきまわして餌をあさるはずだということを彼女は分かっていた。そこで温めた餌を夜に与えてから寝かせることに決めた。そしてそのとおりやってみたが、事態は前と変わらなかった。</p>
<p>戦時下という状況がまた、養鶏には向かなかった。餌は乏しく、質がよくなかった。<a href="#calibre_link-56">それにサマータイム法が議会で可決されると、夏時間の9時頃ではニワトリは頑として寝つかなかった。</a>小屋に入れて寝つかせないと静かにならなかったから、9時でも十分遅い時間だ。なのに、いまや彼らは10時か、それを過ぎてもニワトリ小屋を振り向くこともせず、元気に歩きまわっているのである。バンフォードもマーチもただ労働のために生きるのは違うと思っていた。夕方には読書をしたり、自転車に乗りたかった。<a href="#calibre_link-57">ことによると、マーチは緑の地の磁器の上に曲線画の白鳥を描きたかったかもしれないし、あるいは凝った細工を施した暖炉の火熱よけ衝立をつくりたかったかもしれない。</a>というのも、彼女はいっぷう変わった気まぐれなところがあり、物に満足できないたちだったからである。しかし、愚かなニワトリたちに邪魔されて、こういうことが何もできなかった。</p>

<p>それよりもひどい災厄があった。<a href="#calibre_link-168">ベーリー農園は、古い木造の納屋と低い切妻屋根の母屋がついている小さな家屋敷で</a>、森のはずれから牧草地ひとつしか離れていなかったが、戦争が始まってからというもの、キツネが悪魔のように現われるのだった。キツネはマーチとバンフォードの鼻先でニワトリをかすめていった。背後でニワトリの悲鳴と、羽ばたきを聞くたびに、バンフォードはびっくりして、大きな眼鏡の奥から眼を見開いて見詰めた。遅かった！また白色レグホンがやられた。これにはがっかりした。</p>
<p>彼女たちは被害を軽くするためにできるかぎりのことをした。キツネを撃ってよいという許可が出ると、ふたりして銃を持って、キツネがやってきそうな時間に見張りに立った。しかし、役には立たなかった。キツネは、彼女たちが相手をするには敏捷すぎた。そんな風にして1年過ぎ、また1年過ぎた。バンフォードの言葉だと、損失で生計を立てているのだった。彼らは夏の間、母屋を貸し、牧草地の隅に離れとしておいてある鉄道の客車の中に引きこもった。これは面白く、なおかつ経済的に助かった。それでも状況は好転しなかった。</p>

<p>ふたりは、いつもはこの上ない友人同士ではあった。バンフォードは神経質で体が弱かったが、暖かく寛大であったし、マーチはとても風変りで、放心することがあったが、奇妙なほど愚痴をこぼさなかったからだ。だが、長い間ふたりだけで暮らしてきたので、互いに対していらいらしたり飽きてしまうことがよくあった。仕事の5分の4はマーチが引き受けていた。彼女は自分が多く仕事をすることを気にしているわけではなかったが、息が抜けないでいた。そのため、ときどきその眼が奇妙な光を放つ時があった。すると、バンフォードはいつもよりいらいらして、意気消沈し、マーチも彼女にとがった口をきいた。年月が経つにつれて彼女たちは、何とはなしに気持ちがくじけ、希望を失っていくようだった。<a href="#calibre_link-374">遠方にある丸味を帯びたホワイトホース丘陵につながる、何ひとつさえぎるものがない、霞んだ広い平野を見渡せる森のそばの牧草地に孤立していると、あまりにも自分たちだけで生きているように思えた。</a>ふたりを支えるものは何もない ―― 希望もなかった。</p>

<p>ふたりともキツネには本当に悩まされた。夏は朝早くに、ニワトリを小屋から出すと同時に、銃を持って見張らなければならなかった。日暮れ時になれば、すぐにまた見張らなまければならない。キツネはとてもずる賢かった。茂みの中を這いつくばるように移動するので蛇のように見分けにくい。わざとふたりを出し抜くようだった。一度か二度、マーチは深い草の中で、キツネの白い尾の先を、あるいは赤みがかった影を見つけ、それに目がけて発砲した。しかし、キツネは気にもかけなかった。</p>
<p>ある日の夕方、マーチは帽子に髪を押し込み銃を抱えて、落日を背に立っていた。見張り半分、瞑想半分、それが彼女のいつもの状態だった。眼は鋭くよく見ているのだが、内心では見たものに注意しなかった。彼女はいつも、口をやや堅く結びながら、この奇妙な忘我状態に陥っていた。彼女には、自分が実際に意識を持ってそこにいるのか、いないのか分からなかった。</p>

<p>森のはずれの樹木は、日がよく当たって黒ずんで、茶色味がかった緑であった ―― 8月の終わりだからだ。その先では、松が銅色の裸の幹と枝を空に輝かせていた。近くには長くて褐色の茎となった荒れ草が日の光を受けている。ニワトリはあたりをうろつき ―― アヒルはまだ松の木の下の池で泳いでいた。マーチはそれらの光景を見詰めていた。眼では見ていたのだが、心では見ていなかった。遠くでニワトリに話しかけるバンフォードの声が聞こえる ―― しかし、彼女は何も聞いていなかった。何を考えているのだろうか。だれにも分からない。あたかも、意識の流れが止まっているようだった。</p>
<p>彼女は眼を落とした。すると突然、キツネの姿が見えた。キツネは彼女を見上げていた。顎を下げて、眼だけで見上げている。その眼が彼女の眼と合った。キツネは彼女を知った。彼女は魔法にかけられた ―― キツネが自分を知ったことを彼女は知った。キツネが彼女の眼を覗き込むと、マーチは呆然とした。キツネは彼女を知ったのだ。恐れていなかった。</p>
<p>マーチはもがき、混乱しながらも我に返った。キツネが去っていくのが見える。地面に落ちた枝をゆっくり跳ね越えた。ゆっくりと生意気な様子で跳んでいった。それから肩越しに振り返り、なめらかな足取りで走り去った。尾が羽根のようにすらりと伸びているのが見えた。白い尻が輝くのが見えた。そしてキツネは静かに、風のように静かに消えた。</p>

<p>発射する振りをするのは馬鹿げたことだと分かっていたが、彼女は銃を肩に構えた。その時でさえ口を閉じていた。それからキツネの跡を、キツネが去った方向にゆっくりと歩きはじめた。ゆっくりと、あきらめないで。きっとキツネを見つけられると思った。心の中では、見つけようと堅く決心をしていた。キツネを見つけたらどうするかは考えなかった。だが、見つける決心はしていた。彼女は眼を爛々と大きく見開き、頬をほんのりと赤くしながら、何も考えないで森のはずれを歩きまわった。何も考えなかった。奇妙な忘我状態で、あちらこちらと歩きまわった。</p>
<p>やっと、バンフォードが自分を呼んでいる声に気付いた。神経を集中させようと努めた。声の方向に向かって叫ぶように返事をすると、それからふたたび母屋に向かって大股で歩きだした。赤い夕日が沈もうとしていた。ニワトリがねぐらに戻って行く。白いのや黒いのが一緒になって鶏小屋に向かっていくのをマーチは見ていた。彼らをじっと見ていたが、魔法にかかったように見えてはいなかった。心はそこになかった。しかし、無意識に頭は働いて、入り口の戸を閉める時間だということは分かっていた。</p>
<p>彼女は、バンフォードが食卓に準備してくれていた夕食をとるために家のなかに入った。バンフォードは気楽におしゃべりをしている。マーチは、男のように相槌も打たず聞いていた。時折短い返事をした。しかし、その間じゅう、魔法にかかったようであった。夕食が済むとすぐにマーチは立ち上がり、理由も言わないで外へ出ていった。</p>

<p>彼女はふたたび銃を取り、キツネを探しに出かけた。なぜなら、キツネが眼を上げて自分を見たからである。その、知っているぞ、という目つきが彼女の頭に刻みこまれてしまったようだった。キツネのことを考えた、というのではなくて、キツネにとりつかれてしまったのだ。その暗い、抜け目のない、ずうずうしい眼が自分のなかを覗き込み、自分を知ったのが分かった。キツネが姿を見せずに自分の心を支配するのが分かった。キツネが見上げる時の、顎の下げ方を知った。金褐色と灰色がかった白の鼻面を知った。肩越しに振り返って自分を見たことをまた思い出した。半ば誘うようで、半ば嘲笑するような、ずるい仕草だった。だからなのか、彼女は驚いた風に大きく見開いた眼を輝かせ、片手に銃を持って、森のはずれに沿って進んだ。そのうちに夜になり、松の木の上に大きな月が昇った。また、バンフォードが呼んでいる。</p>
<p>それで彼女は家に戻って、黙って忙しく手を動かした。ランプの明かりのそばで、うわの空で銃を点検し、手入れをした。それからふたたび、月が輝くなかを、万事異常はないか調べるために外に出て行った。深紅に染まった空を背に、黒々とした松の木の梢が見えた時、また彼女の心臓は、キツネよ、キツネよ、と高鳴った。銃を担いだまま、キツネの後について行きたかった。</p>

<p>マーチがそのことをバンフォードに話したのは数日経ってからだった。ある晩、彼女は突然言った。</p>
<p>「土曜日の夜、キツネがわたしの足もとにいたの」</p>
<p>「どこで？」眼鏡の奥で眼をまん丸くしながらバンフォードは言った。</p>
<p>「ちょうど池のそばに立っていた時よ」<span>	</span></p>
<p>「撃ったの？」バンフォードは叫んだ。</p>
<p>「撃たなかった」</p>
<p>「どうして？」</p>
<p>「そうね、驚いて撃つのを忘れたのよ、多分」</p>
<p>マーチはいつもの、ゆっくりした口調で、言葉少なだった。バンフォードはしばらく友を見詰めた。</p>
<p>「キツネと眼が合ったの？」</p>
<p>「そうなのよ！わたしを見上げてたわ、とても平然と」</p>
<p>「まったくのところ」とバンフォードは叫んだ ――「生意気なのよ！あいつらはわたしたちを恐れていないのね、ネリー」</p>
<p>「たしかにね」とマーチは言った。</p>
<p>「残念だったわね。1発ぶっぱなしてやればよかった」とバンフォードは言った。</p>
<p>「たしかに残念よ。それからずっと探しているの。でも近くに来ないんじゃないかしら」</p>
<p>「そうね、来ないと思うわ」とバンフォードは言った。</p>

<p>バンフォードはキツネのことを忘れはじめた。ただ、物乞いの生意気さに対するよりもキツネには腹を立てていた。マーチもまた、キツネのことを考えていることを意識しなかった。しかし、半ば瞑想状態であり、半ば忘我状態にある時、そして視界に入るものを半ば認識している時はいつでも、自分の無意識を支配し、瞑想世界の空白部分の半分を占めているのが、あのキツネであった。このようにして数週間、数か月が過ぎた。リンゴを取ろうとして木によじ登っている時、最後のスモモをたたき落としている時、あるいは、アヒルの池から水を引く溝を掘っている時、あるいは小屋をかたづけている時、そうした仕事が終わり腰を伸ばす時、額にさがった髪の房を払いのける時、その年齢の女性としては年寄りじみた感じのする、奇妙にすぼめるように口を堅く結ぶ時、以前キツネが自分を見詰めた、その時の魔力がよみがえってきた。そういう時にはキツネの匂いさえした。それはいつも思いがけぬ時にやって来た。夜眠りにつこうとする時にも、お茶をたてるためにティーポットに湯を入れようとする時にも ―― キツネが現れるのだ。魔力にかけられているようだった。</p>
<p>そのようにして数か月が過ぎた。森に向かって歩くと、マーチは無意識のうちに、あいかわらずキツネを探していた。キツネは彼女の心の中の固定観念になった。絶えずというのではないが、間をおいて繰りかえす形で、いつまでも消えない固定観念だった。何を感じ、何を思っているのかは自分では分からなかった。ただ、キツネに見られた時のような精神状態になったのである。</p>

<p>数か月過ぎ、夜が早く暗くなってきた。重苦しくて暗い11月が来たのだ。マーチは長靴で、足首まで泥に埋まって歩きまわった。4時になると日が暮れてしまう。朝が来ても、本当の夜明けとは言いがたい。娘たちはふたりともこの時節を恐れていた。森の近くの荒れはてた小農園にいる自分たちを包む、途切れない暗闇を恐れた。バンフォードは震えがくるほど怖がった。浮浪者かだれかが辺りをうろつきまわるのではないかと恐れていた。マーチの方は恐れはしなかったが不快で不安であった。彼女は体じゅうに不愉快さと陰うつさを感じた。</p>
<p>いつも、ふたりの娘は居間でお茶を飲んだ。マーチは暗くなると暖炉の火をおこし、昼間に切って割った薪をくべた。そのあとには長い夜が来た。外はじめじめしていて、真っ暗だ。家のなかは寂しく、重苦しく、少し陰うつだった。マーチは黙っていることで満足していたが、バンフォードは黙っていられなかった。外の松の木に吹く風の音や、雨だれの音を聞いているだけでは我慢できなかったのである。</p>

<p>ある晩のこと、ふたりで台所で茶器を洗ったあと、マーチは上履きにはき替え、今までゆっくりと編み進めてきたひと巻のかぎ針編みを手に取った。黙り込んだままだ。バンフォードは赤い暖炉の火を見詰めていた。燃料が薪なので、いつも注意しなければならなかった。彼女はあまり早い時間から読書をはじめたくなかった。長時間、眼を使えなかったからである。それで彼女は暖炉を見詰め、遠くから聞えてくる音、牛の鳴く声や、鈍くて重たく湿った風の音、ここからあまり遠くない支線を走る夜行列車の、車輪のガタコトという音に耳を傾けていた。暖炉の赤い焔に、彼女はほとんど魂を奪われていた。</p>
<p>突然、ふたりの娘ははぎくりとして、顔をあげた。足音が聞こえたのだ ―― 紛れもない、足音だ。バンフォードは怖くて震え上がった。マーチは立ち上がって耳を澄ませた。それからすばやく、台所に通じるドアに近づいた。同時に裏口のドアに近づく足音が聞こえた。ふたりは一瞬待った。裏口のドアが静かに開いた。バンフォードは大きな叫び声を上げた。ものやわらかい男の声が聞こえた。</p>
<p>「今晩は！」</p>

<p>マーチはひるんだが、部屋の隅から銃を取った。</p>
<p>「何の用？」彼女は鋭い声で訊いた。</p>
<p>またも、静かで、やわらかに響く男の声がした。</p>
<p>「今晩は！どうかしたんですか？」</p>
<p>「撃つわよ！」とマーチは叫んだ。「何の用？」</p>
<p>「おや、どうしたんです？どうかしたんですか？」静かで、不思議がっていて、幾分、怖がっている声だった。重い背嚢を背負った若い兵士がぼんやりした光のなかに現われた。</p>
<p>「では」と彼は言った。「ここに住んでいるのはだれなのですか？」</p>
<p>「わたしたちよ」とマーチは言った。「何の用なの？」</p>
<p>「じゃあ」と若い兵士は長く引き伸ばす、うたうような、不思議そうな声で言った。「ウィリアム・グレンフェルはここには住んでいないんですか？」</p>
<p>「住んでいません。お分かりの通りよ」</p>
<p>「僕が？分かるって？分かりやしません、嘘じゃないですよ。その人はここに住んでいたんです。僕の祖父です。僕自身も5年前にここに住んでいました。じゃあ、祖父はどうなったのですか？」</p>

<div id="calibre_link-647">
<div><div><div><div><div><p><a href="#calibre_link-648">2-D</a><br /></p>
<p>その若い男 ―― まだ二十を越えないかくらいの青年 ―― は進み出て、戸口の内側に立っていた。マーチはすでに、この奇妙なやわらかで抑えた声を聞いて魔法にかかったかのように彼を見詰めていた。丸い赤ら顔で、金色がかっている長めの髪は汗で額にくっついている。眼は青くきらきら輝き鋭かった。頬や、生き生きとした赤味がかった皮膚には、一見、細い金色の産毛のように見えるが、それよりも堅そうな毛が生えていた。そのせいで彼は少し輝くように見えた。重い背嚢を背負っていたので、前かがみで首を前に突き出している。手には帽子がゆるく握られていた。男はするどく輝く眼で、娘たちをかわるがわる、とくにマーチを見詰めていた。彼女は、ベルトつきのコートにゲートルを巻いたままのかっこうで、髪は後ろで大きくきれいに束ねていて、眼は大きく見開かれたまま、まだ銃を手にしたまま青ざめて立っていた。その後ろでは、バンフォードがソファの腕にしがみつき、顔を半ば背けながら縮みあがっている。</p>
<p>「祖父がここに住んでいるとばかり思ったんです。もう死んだんですか？」</p>
<p>「わたしたちは3年前からここに住んでいるわ」とバンフォードが言った。汗じみた長髪がまつわりついている丸みをおびた彼の顔に少年らしさが残っているのを知って、動転していた彼女は平静さを取り戻しかけていた。</p>
<p>「3年前ですって！まさか。3年前から住んでいるのに、前にだれが住んでいたかご存知ないのですか？」</p>
<p>「おじいさんだったそうよ。ひとり住まいの」</p>
<p>「そうです！それが僕の祖父です！それで、その人はどうなったのでしょうか？」</p>
<p>「亡くなったのよ。そう聞いたわ」</p>
<p>「そうなんだ！死んだのか！」</p>

<p>若者は顔色も表情も変えないで彼女たちを見詰めた。かすかな困惑と驚きの交じった表情のほかに、何か表情があるとすれば、それはふたりの娘たちに対する強い好奇心だった。強い、体そのものが表す好奇心で、その丸い若々しい顔そのものが、好奇心であった。</p>
<p>しかし、マーチにとって彼はキツネであった。顔を突き出しているせいなのか、赤味を帯びた頬骨の上の白っぽい毛の輝きのせいなのか、輝く鋭い眼のせいなのか、それらのどれがそういう印象を与えるのか言い難いが、若者は彼女にとってキツネであった。それ以外には見えなかった。</p>
<p>「どうしてお祖父さんが生きているか死んでいるか分からないの？」とバンフォードは、ようやく取り戻した持ち前の辛辣な口調で聞いた。</p>
<p>「ああ、そのことですか」とやわらかい息遣いで青年は答えた。「ほら、僕はカナダで入隊したでしょう。3、4年消息を聞かなかった。カナダに逃げ出したんです」</p>
<p><a href="#calibre_link-689">「フランスから帰還したばかりなの？」</a><br /></p>
<p><a href="#calibre_link-689">「ええ ―― 実際はサロニカからですけれど」</a><br /></p>

<p>話が途切れた。3人ともどう言ったらよいか分からなかった。</p>
<p>「それで今どこへ行ったらよいか分からないの？」とバンフォードは、やや唐突に訊いた。</p>
<p>「ええ。村には知っている人はいますが。<a href="#calibre_link-74">ともかく『白鳥亭』に行くことはできます</a>」</p>
<p>「列車で来たんでしょう？少し座ったらどうかしら」</p>
<p>「そうですね。そうさせていただきます」</p>
<p>青年は、奇妙な小さいうめき声をあげて背嚢をおろした。バンフォードはマーチを見た。</p>
<p>「銃を置いて」と彼女は言った。「お茶にしましょう」</p>
<p>「そうですね」と若者は言った。「銃は見飽きていますからね」</p>
<p>若者はソファに疲れ切ったように腰をおろして前かがみになった。</p>
<p>マーチは動揺が収まり、台所に行った。思いにふけるようなものやわらかな若い声が台所まで聞こえてきた。</p>
<p>「驚きましたよ。戻って来たらこんな風に変わっているとは！」そう言いながら彼はまったく悲しげではなかった。むしろ興味ありげな驚きの表情をしていた。</p>
<p>「ここも随分と変わりましたね」と彼は部屋を見まわしながら続けた。</p>
<p>「変わったのがお分かりなのね」とバンフォードは言った。</p>
<p>「ええ、分かるどころじゃありませんよ！」</p>
<p>彼の眼は異様なほどに澄んで輝いた。といっても、それははちきれんばかりの健康の輝きだったが。</p>

<p>マーチは台所で2度目のお茶の用意をしていた。7時頃だった。そうしている最中も、居間にいる若者を忘れなかった。話の内容を聞き取るというよりも、そのやわらかな声の流れを感じとっていた。彼女は自分の感情に流されないようにするため、まるで糸で縫い付けたように唇をすぼめ、口をますます堅く結んだ。しかし、それに反して眼だけは大きく見開き輝いている。我を忘れていた。手早く無頓着にパンを厚く切り、バターはなかったからマーガリンをつけて食事の用意をした。盆の上に乗せるものはほかに何かないかと考えた ―― しかし、パンとマーガリンとジャムしかなかった。食料貯蔵庫が空だったのである。呪文を唱えて何かを出すこともできず、盆を持って居間に戻った。</p>
<p>彼女は自分に注意を向けてもらいたくなかった。とくに若者には見られたくなかった。しかし彼女が入って行き、ちょうど彼の後ろで食卓の用意をしていると、若者は伸ばしていた脚を引いて、振り向いて肩越しに彼女を見た。彼女は青ざめ、血の気を失った。</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-110">
<div><div><div><div><div><p><a href="#calibre_link-111">2-H</a><br /></p>
<p>若者は、マーチが食卓の上に腰をかがめると、彼女のほっそりした形のよい脚を見た。腿の上に垂れているベルト付きコートを、束ねられている黒髪を見た。彼の強く、何にでも向けられる好奇心が、ふたたび彼女に向けられた。</p>
<p>ランプには暗緑色のシェードがついていたので、明かりは下に向かい部屋の上半分はほの暗かった。彼の顔の動きは光を受けてよく見えたが、遠く離れていたマーチは影のようだった。</p>
<p>彼女は、視線を避けたまま、黒いまつ毛を上下に動かしながら振り向いた。結んだ口を開けて、バンフォードに言った。</p>
<p>「お茶をついでくださる？」</p>
<p>それからまた台所に戻った。</p>
<p>「そこで召し上がる？」とバンフォードは若者に訊いた ――「食卓にお出でにならないなら」</p>
<p>「そうですね」と彼は言った。「ここがとても快適なんで、さしつかえなればここでいただきます」</p>
<p>「パンとジャムしかないわよ」と彼女は言った。そして彼のそばの腰掛けに皿を置いた。彼をもてなすことができて彼女はとても幸せだった。バンフォードは社交的だった。若者のことは、自分の弟でもあるかのようにもはや恐れなかった。実際、若者は弟のように若かったのだ。</p>
<p>「ネリー」と彼女は呼んだ。「あなたにもお茶をついだわよ」</p>
</div>

<div><div><div><div><div><p><a href="#calibre_link-334">2-I</a><br /></p>
<p>マーチは部屋の入口に姿を現した。ティーカップを手に取ると、できるだけ明かりから離れた隅に座った。膝頭がひどく気になる。それを隠すスカートはなく、膝を出したまま座らなければならないのには困った。彼女は見られないように、とできるだけ身を縮めていた。すると、若者は脚を伸ばしてソファに深く座り、いつまでもマーチをじっと覗き込むように見上げていたので、彼女は消えてしまいたかった。それでも、彼女はこぼれないようにカップをうまく持ち、お茶を飲み、口を閉じて顔を背けた。姿が見えないようにしたいという彼女の願望が強いことが分かると若者は困惑した。これでは彼女をはっきりとは見ることができない。彼女は影になかにある影のように見えた。しかし、つねに彼の眼は彼女に戻ってきて、無意識のうちにじっと注意を向け、絶え間なく探った。</p>
<p>そのあいだ、バンフォードにはものやわらかく、慇懃に話しかけていた。何よりもゴシップ好きなバンフォードは、小鳥のさえずりのように無遠慮にたくさん聞きたがった。彼もまた腹いっぱい、すばやくがつがつと食べた。だから、マーチはさらにパンとマーガリンを切ってこなければならなかった。パンがきれいに切れていないことをバンフォードは謝った。</p>
<p>「駄目なのよ」とマーチは突然言った。「パンにつけるバターがないんだから、きれいに切っても仕方がないのよ」</p>
<p>また若者はマーチを見た。そして突然歯を見せて、鼻にしわを寄せて短く笑った。</p>
<p>「そうなんですよね」と彼はものやわらかで吐息のような声で答えた。</p>

<p><a href="#calibre_link-273">若者は生まれも育ちもコーンウォールのようだった。12歳の時、祖父とベーリー農園に来たが、祖父とは折り合いが悪かった。カナダへ逃げ、西部で働き、そして今ここに来た ―― そういう次第だった。</a><br /></p>
<p>彼は娘たちについて非常に興味を抱き、彼女たちが何をしているのかはっきりしたことを知りたがった。彼の質問は農園で働いた者でなければできないものだった。鋭く、実際的で、からかい口調がほんの少しまじっていた。損失についての彼女たちの態度を面白がった。というのも、若い牝牛や家畜の損失についてのふたりの態度が面白かったからである。</p>
<p>「仕方がないのよ」とマーチが口をはさんだ。「働くために生きているわけでないし」</p>
<p>「そうですか」と彼は応じた。また顔をほころばして、若者らしい短い笑い声をあげた。彼は部屋の隅にいる、ぼんやりと見える女にじっと視線を注いだ。</p>
<p>「でも、元手が尽きたらどうするつもりなのですか？」と彼は言った。</p>
<p>「そうね。分からないわ」とマーチは言葉少なに答えた。「日雇い労働者として雇ってもらうことになるかも」</p>
<p>「けれども、戦争が終わったんだから、女性の日雇い求人はないんじゃないかなあ」と若者は言った。</p>
<p>「仕方がないわよ。様子をみるわ。もう少しは持ちこたえるだろうし」とマーチは言った。その悲しげに響く声は、半ば冷笑的で無関心な調子だった。</p>

<p>バンフォードは笑い出した。</p>
<p>「言葉に気をつけてね」と彼女はさえぎった。「わたしたちは十分有能なのよ」</p>
<p>「そうね」とマーチはゆっくりした悲しげな声で言った。「有能という問題ではないわ。農業をするつもりなら、朝から晩まで、それにかからなければならないのよ。家畜になったようなものよ」</p>
<p>「その通りですね」と若者が言った。「そうなりたくないということですね」</p>
<p>「ええ、その通り」とマーチは言った。「でも、そうなっているって分かっているの」</p>
<p>「わたしたちは自分の時間がほしいのよ」とバンフォードが言った。</p>
<p>若者はソファの上で身をのけぞらせると、顔をひきつらせて笑った。声を立てずに、腹の底から笑った。娘たちの平然とした自虐的な態度がひどくおかしかったのである。</p>
<p>「そうでしょうね。ではどうして始めたんです？」</p>
<p>「それはね」とマーチは言った。「わたしたち、始めた時はニワトリの性質（ネイチャー）を買いかぶっていたのね」</p>
<p>「それに自然（ネイチャー）全体についてもよ」とバンフォードは言った。「もう自然という言葉を聞きたくないわ」</p>
<p>また若者は顔をひきつらせて愉快そうに笑った。</p>
<p>「ニワトリや牛について、よく思っていないのですね」と若者が言った。</p>
<p>「思っていないわ。落第点よ」とマーチは言った。</p>
<p>彼は声を立てて笑った。</p>
<p>「ニワトリも若い牝牛もだめ」とバンフォードは言った。「山羊も天気も」</p>
<p>若者は喜んで、大きな甲高い声で笑った。女性たちも笑いはじめた。マーチもおかしがって顔を背け、口もとにしわを寄せた。</p>
<p>「まあいいでしょう」とバンフォードは言った。「ネリー。わたしたち、そんなこと気にしていないわよね？」</p>

<p>若者は面白がっていた。彼は腹いっぱい食べてお茶を飲んだ。バンフォードは彼に質問しはじめた。名前はヘンリー・グレンフェル ―― でも、ハリーではなくていつもヘンリーと呼ばれている、と言った。彼は礼儀正しく、明快でまじめだが、その話しぶりには魅力があった。マーチは、話に加わっていなかったので、部屋の隅から若者を長い間、ゆっくりと観察した。彼は両手で膝をかかえてソファに座り、ランプに照らされた顔は明るく、きびきびとした表情を浮かべながらバンフォードの方を向いていた。彼女は、ようやく落ち着きを取り戻した。彼はキツネと同じだわ ―― 今、目の前に逃げもせずにいる。追いかける必要はないわ、とマーチは思った。隅の影の中で、彼女は我が身にかけられた魔法を受け入れて、ほとんど眠っているといっていいような、暖かくのんびりした平和な気持ちに身をゆだねていた。だが、それでも彼女は隠れたままでいたかった。彼が自分のことを忘れてバンフォードに話しかけている間だけ、完全に平和な気持ちでいられたからだ。部屋の隅の影に隠れていれば、双方に意識を保とうとして、自己分裂することはなかった。彼女は、やっとキツネの匂いの中に浸ることができた。</p>
<p>それというのも、軍服姿で暖炉の前に座っている若者は、部屋の中にかすかだが独特の匂いを発散させていた。はっきりと識別はできないが、野生の動物のような匂いだ。マーチは、もうその匂いを避けようとはしなかった。洞穴の中に逃げ込んでいる動物のように、隅でじっと静かにやすらいだ気持ちになっていた。</p>

<p>とうとう話が途切れた。若者は膝をかかえていた手を緩めて、少し体を起こすと周囲を見た。するとまた、隅で沈黙を守る、半分しか見えない女に気が付いた。</p>
<p>「さてと」と彼は気が進まない様子で言った。「おいとました方がよさそうですね。そうしないと『白鳥亭』がしまってしまうでしょうから」</p>
<p>「もう寝てしまったんじゃないのかしら」とバンフォードは言った。「あそこは今みんなインフルエンザにかかっているから」</p>
<p>「そうなんですか！」と彼は叫ぶと、じっと考えた。「まあ」と彼は続けた。「どこか泊まるところをさがします」</p>
<p>「ここに泊まってもいいわよ。でもね ――」とバンフォードは口を切った。</p>
<p>彼は、顔を前に突き出して彼女を見詰めた。</p>
<p>「何か問題なのですか」と訊いた。</p>
<p>「そうね」と彼女は言った。「世間体のことね」彼女はやや落ち着きをなくした。</p>
<p>「世間体が悪いということはないでしょう？」彼はおだやかに驚いてみせながら言った。</p>
<p>「わたしたちはかまわないわよ」バンフォードは言った。</p>
<p>「もちろん僕だって問題はありません」彼は純情な少年らしい真面目さで言った。「結局、ある意味じゃ、僕の家ですからね」</p>

<p>「ネリー、どう思う？」とバンフォードは訊いた。</p>
<p>「わたしはかまわないわ」とマーチは断言する調子で言った。「とにかくわたしには村の人たちなんてどうでもいいのよ」</p>
<p>「その通りだ」と若者はすばやく、ものやわらかに言った。「それがどうだというのですか？つまり、村の人たちが何か批判することがあるのでしょうか？」</p>
<p>「そうだわ」とマーチは強い調子で、きっぱりと言った。「村の人たちは何にだって何かしら言うわよ。でも、だれが何を言おうと関係ないもの。人の世話にならなければよいのよ」</p>
<p>「もちろん、その通り」と若者は言った。</p>
<p>「それなら、よければうちに泊まってもいいわよ」とバンフォードが言った。「空いている部屋はいつでも使えるから」</p>
<p>若者の顔はうれしさで輝いていた。</p>
<p>「ひどく面倒をかけることにならなければいいですが」と彼は持ち前のやわらかで丁重な口調で言った。</p>
<p>「面倒なことはないわよ」とふたりは答えた。</p>

<p>マーチは部屋を用意するために姿を消した。バンフォードはフランスから弟が帰国したかのように喜び、親切であった。彼の面倒を見て、彼のために風呂の用意をしたり、その他のすべてのことをすることで、自分の弟の面倒を見るのと同様の満足を感じた。バンフォードの生まれつきの暖かさと親切さが今、そのはけ口を見つけたのだ。若者は彼女が示す姉のような世話に満足した。しかし、マーチが黙って自分のために仕事をしているのを知って、彼は少しばかり当惑していた。彼女は妙に黙りこくって目立たずにいる。自分は彼女を本当に見たことがないように思った。もし道で会っても彼女だと識別できないと感じた。</p>
<p>その夜、マーチは生々しい夢を見た。夢の中で、自分には理解できない歌声を家の外に聞いた。家の周囲、牧草地、暗闇の中に、さまよう歌声だ。感動して泣きたくなった。外に出てみると、突然、それはキツネの鳴き声だということが分かった。キツネは小麦のような濃い黄色に輝いていた。彼女が近寄るとキツネは逃げ、うたうのをやめた。キツネは近くにいるようだ。彼女はキツネに触りたかった。触れようと手を伸ばした。すると突然、キツネは彼女の手首を噛んだ。彼女が身を引くと同時に、キツネは跳び去ろうと向きをかえ、尾で彼女の顔をさっとなでた。その尾は燃えているようであった。彼女の口を焼き焦がし、ひどい痛みを与えたからである。彼女はその痛みで目を覚ました。本当に焼かれたかのように震えながら横たわっていた。</p>

<div><div><div><div><div><p><a href="#calibre_link-252">3-B</a><br /></p>
<p>だが、朝になるとその夢は遠い記憶になった。起きると家事や、ニワトリの世話に忙しかった。バンフォードは食料を買いに村に自転車を走らせた。彼女はもてなし好きであった。しかし残念なことに、1918年という年には、たいして食料は買えなかった。若者はシャツ姿のまま2階から降りて来た。彼は若くて生き生きしていた。だが、歩く時に首を前に突き出すことで、背骨が少し曲がっているかのように両肩が丸く上がって見えた。彼は若くて元気だったから、姿勢のせいに違いない。女たちが朝食の用意をしている間、彼は顔を洗って外に出た。</p>
<p>彼はあらゆるものを見渡し、すべて調べた。好奇心が強く、飽くことを知らなかった。彼は農場の現在の状態と彼が記憶している過去の状態とを比べた。そしてその変化が生み出した効果について思い巡らした。ニワトリとアヒルを見てその状態を調べ、頭上を飛ぶ山鳩を眺めた。かなりたくさん飛んでいる。木に残っているリンゴを見た。マーチには取れなかったものだ。<a href="#calibre_link-19">彼女たちがポンプを借りてきているのを知った。おそらく家の北側にある、大きな軟水の水槽から水を汲むためであった</a>。</p>

<p>「おかしな、荒れた古い家だね」と彼は朝食の食卓で娘たちに言った。</p>
<p>考えを巡らせている時、彼の眼には賢さと子どもらしい無邪気さが現われた。あまり口をきかず、たくさん食べた。マーチは彼の方を見ないようにしていた。早朝には、彼女もまた、彼を意識できなかった。しかし、彼の着ているカーキ色の軍服の輝きの何かが、彼女に夢のキツネの輝きを思い出させた。</p>
<p>日中、娘たちは自分の仕事をした。彼のほうは、午前中は銃の手入れをした。野ウサギを1羽、森に向かって高く飛んでいる野鴨を1羽、仕留めた。おかげで空っぽの食料貯蔵庫は豊かになった。娘たちは彼がすでに自分の食費を稼いだことを感じとった。しかし、彼は出ていくとは一言も口にしなかった。午後になると彼は村に行った。戻って来たのはお茶の時間だった。丸味をおびた顔には前に見せたのと同じく、抜け目ない先を見抜くような表情が現われていた。さっと体をひねって木釘に帽子をかけた。何かを考えているようだった。</p>

<p>「どうしたらよいかって ―― どういう意味？」とバンフォードが言った。</p>
<p>「村のどこに泊まればいいかということです」と彼は言った。</p>
<p>「分からないわ」と彼女は言った。「どこに泊まろうと思っているの？」</p>
<p>「さあ、その」 ―― 彼はためらった ―― 「<a href="#calibre_link-5">『白鳥亭』はインフルエンザにかかっているし、『鋤と砕土具亭』では軍馬用の干し草を取り入れている兵隊がいるし。</a>その上、村の民家には兵士が10人と伍長がひとり泊まっているそうです。僕はどこに泊まったらよいか分かりません」</p>
<p>彼は彼女たちに問題を預けた。それについてはこれ以上口を出さなかった。マーチは食卓に肘をついて両手に顎をのせて、無意識に彼を見ていた。突然、彼は黒味がかった青い眼を上げ、何も考えないでマーチの眼を覗き込んだ。ふたりともびっくりした。彼も少し身を引いた。彼が頭を横に向けた時、マーチは、キツネのときと同じ、ずるくあざけった、知っているぞ、というようなきらめきが彼の眼から飛び跳ねるのを感じた。あのキツネの暗い眼から入ったように、それが彼女の魂の中に入り込むのを感じた。マーチは苦しんでいるかのように、あるいは眠っているかのように口を固く閉じた。</p>

<p>しかし、マーチは眼を見開いたまま黙っていた。そして若者は、魅せられたかのように、まばたきもせずじっとマーチを見詰めていた。</p>
<p>「さあ、何か返事して」とバンフォードは言った。そう言われてマーチは頭をやや横に向けた。意識を取り戻すか、取り戻そうとしているかのようだった。</p>
<p>「わたしにどう言ってもらいたいの？」と機械的に彼女は尋ねた。</p>
<p>「考えていることを言って」バンフォードは言った。</p>
<p>「わたしはどちらでもいいのよ」とマーチは答えた。</p>
<p>また、みんな黙った。鋭い光が若者の眼に現われた。針が突き抜けるような光だった。</p>
<p>「わたしもよ」バンフォードは言った。「よければ泊まっていいわよ」</p>

<p>ずるい小さな焔のような微笑が突然、知らず知らずのうちに彼の顔に浮かんだ。彼はそれを隠すためにすばやく下を向いた。そのままうつむいて、顔を隠していた。</p>
<p>「よければここに泊まっていてもいいわよ。ヘンリー、好きなようにしなさい」とバンフォードは結んだ。</p>
<p>それでも彼は返事をしないで、下を向いたままだった。それから顔を上げた。あたかも大喜びのようで、奇妙な光で輝いている顔だった。妙に澄んでいる眼でマーチを見詰めていた。彼女は顔を背けた。口元は傷ついていたようにゆがみ、意識はぼんやりしていた。</p>
<p>バンフォードはやや困惑しはじめた。若者の澄んだ眼が、マーチをじっと見詰めているのに気が付いたからだ。顔のどの部分も動かさなかったから、どうやって微笑しているかは分からないが、バンフォードには彼の顔に見えない微笑が輝くのが分かった。頬の細かな毛がきらめいているだけのようだった。それから彼は表情をがらりと変えてバンフォードを見た。</p>

<p>「本当に」とやわらかで、丁寧な口調で彼は言った。「とても親切にしてくださって。お礼の言葉もありません。ご迷惑にちがいないのに」</p>
<p>「ネリー、パンを少し切ってちょうだい」と不安げにバンフォードは言って、こうつけ加えた。「滞在したいのなら、迷惑ということはないのよ。弟を数日泊まらせるようなものですもの。わたしの弟は、あなたぐらいの子なの」</p>
<p>「とてもご親切に、ありがとうございます」と若者は繰り返した。「ご迷惑でなければ、ぜひ泊めていただきたいです」</p>
<p>「もちろん迷惑ということはないわよ。実際、わたしたち以外の人が家にいてくれた方が楽しいわ」と暖かくバンフォードは言った。</p>
<p>「でもマーチさんはどうですか」と彼は彼女を見ながらやわらかな声で言った。</p>
<p>「わたしのことなら問題ないわ」とマーチは、あいまいに言った。</p>
<p>若者はにっこりと微笑んだ。うれしくて両手をこすらんばかりだった。</p>
<p>「それなら」と彼は言った。「食費を払わせてもらい、仕事を手伝わせてもらえばありがたいです」</p>
<p>「食費のことはいいのよ」とバンフォードは言った。</p>

<p>一両日過ぎた。若者は農園に宿泊し続けた。バンフォードは若者が気に入った。彼は話し方がやわらかで、丁寧であったからだ。自分のことを言うのを控えて、バンフォードが言いたいことを聞き、すばやく、半ばからかうように笑った。彼はすすんで仕事の手伝いをした ―― しかし、手伝い過ぎることはなかった。銃を手にひとりで出かけて、見張ったり、外を眺めたりすることが好きだった。彼の眼は鋭く、体そのものが好奇心のかたまりで、飽くことを知らず見て回った。たったひとりで、半ば隠れて見て回っている時がいちばん自由だったからでもあった。</p>
<p>とりわけ、彼はマーチを見詰めていた。彼にとって彼女は奇妙な存在だ。優雅な青年のような彼女の姿には魅力があった。彼女の眼を覗き込むと、その黒い瞳に彼の中のあるものが呼び覚まされ、妙にひどく興奮した。それは強烈であったが、密やかなもので、他人に知られたくないような興奮であった。それに彼女のいっぷう変わった辛辣な言葉は、彼を心から笑わせた。前に進まなければならないと思った。彼は不可避な衝動に動かされていた。しかし、今は彼女について考えることを脇に置き、銃を持って森のはずれへと行った。</p>

<p>家に戻った時には夕暮れだった。暗くなるとともに、11月末の細かな雨が降って来た。居間の窓に暖炉の火がとび跳ねているのが見える。小さなかたまりの暗い建物の中に跳ねる明かりだ。ここを自分のものにすることは素敵じゃないかと彼は思った。それから、狡猾そうにこう考えた。マーチと結婚するっていうのはどうだ？彼はしばらくじっと、牧草地の真ん中に立っていた。片手に死んだウサギを持ったまま、この考えに耽った。彼は心の中で驚きながらも考えた ―― どうも計算しているらしく ―― ひとり頷くと、奇妙な微笑みを浮かべた。悪いことなんてあるもんか。とてもいい考えだ。ちょっと滑稽だとしても、それが何だ。どうして問題になるのか。彼女が年上だとしても、それが何だ。問題ではない。彼女の驚いているような、傷つきやすい黒い眼を思い出すと、ひとりでにずる賢い微笑が浮かんだ。本当は自分の方が年上だ。彼女を御することができる。</p>

<p>彼はその意図を自分でもようやく認める程度だった。自分に対しても秘密にしておいた。まだ雲をつかむような話だ。成り行きを見なければならない。その通り。成り行きを見なければ。気を付けて事を進めないと、彼女に軽蔑されるだけで終わるだろう。いくら自分がずるく巧妙でも、何の用意もなしに彼女のところに行って「マーチさん、好きだ。結婚してほしい」と言ったら、返事は決まって「出ていって。そんなたわごとは聞きたくない」ということになるだろう。これが彼女の、言い寄る男たちと、その「たわごと」に対する返事だ。用心しないと、彼女に持ち前の痛烈で皮肉な軽蔑の言葉を浴びせられて、農園から追い出され、その上、彼女の心からも永久に追い出されてしまうだろう。優しく近づかなければならない。狩猟の時に、シカやヤマシギを捕らえるように、彼女を捕らえなければならない。森の中に入っていってシカに向かって、「どうか弾丸に当たってください」と言ったってなんの効果もない。それじゃだめだ。狩りはゆっくりと巧妙にしなければならない。シカを捕らえに行く時は、体を絞るのだ。体を丸くして自分の中にしまい込むようにする。そして夜明け前、山の中に忍び込む。狩猟に行く時は、何をするかではなくて、どう考えるか、だ。巧妙に、ずるく完璧に相手を倒す用意をする。運命のようにふるまうことだ。ハンター自身の運命が捕らえようとしているシカの運命に追いつき、シカの運命を決定する。まずは獲物が見える前に、催眠術のような奇妙な戦いがある。ハンターの体から魂が抜け出して、シカをまったく見ないうちから、シカの魂に食らいつく。シカの魂は逃げようとしてもがく。シカがハンターの気配に気付く前にそうするんだ。それは見えない世界で起こる、巧妙で深遠な、意志と意志との戦いだ。ハンターの弾丸がシカを貫くまで続く戦いだ。ハンターが十分な程度まで心の用意をして、射程距離まで近づきさえすれば、ビンを撃つ時のように狙いをつける必要はない。獲物の心臓に弾丸を運ぶのはハンター自身の「意志」だ。弾丸の飛翔はハンターの運命がシカの運命に向かって飛んでいくことに過ぎない。それは至上なる願望の行為であり、至上なる意志の行為だ。汚い策を使うのではない。</p>

<p>彼は精神的にハンターであった。農夫でもなく、連隊に所属した兵士でもなかった。彼がマーチを獲物として仕留め、妻にしようと願うのは、若いハンターとしてであった。だから彼は巧妙に体を絞り、一種の見えない状態になろうとした。どのように進むかは確信がもてなかった。マーチはウサギのように彼のことを胡散臭いと思っている。だから表面上では、その家に2週間ほど滞在する、感じはよいが、どこか変わった行きずりの若者であるという態度をとり続けた。</p>
<p>午後になると、彼は暖炉にくべる薪を作っていた。外は早い時間に暗くなり、まだ冷たい、うすら寒い霧がかかっていた。ほとんど何も見えないほど暗くなってきている。短く切りそろえられた丸太が仕事台のそばに積み重ねられていた。彼が最後の薪をせっせと切っていると、薪を家の中か、小屋に入れるためかマーチが近づいて来た。彼は上着を脱いで仕事をしていた。彼女が近づいて来たのに気が付かなかった。はにかんでいるようにもじもじしながら来ると、彼女は切り口の光る丸太に向かって腰をかがめようとしていた。彼は鋸を引く手を止めた。稲妻のような火が彼の脚の神経に走った。</p>

<p>「マーチさん？」と彼は温和な、若々しい声で言った。</p>
<p>重ねていた薪から彼女が眼を上げた。</p>
<p>「なあに」と彼女は言った。</p>
<p>彼は夕闇の中で彼女を見下ろした。それほどはっきりとは見えなかった。</p>
<p>「お願いしたいことがあるんです」と彼は言った。</p>
<p>「そう、何なの？」と彼女は言った。その声にはすでに恐れが現われていた。しかし、彼女は心の乱れを抑えた。</p>
<p>「あのですね」と彼の声はやわらかく、巧妙に引き伸ばされたようだった。それは彼女の神経にしみとおった。「そう、何だと思いますか？」</p>
<p>彼女は体を起こすと、両手を腰の後ろに当てた。じっと動かないで彼を見詰めて立っていたが、返事はしなかった。彼はまた、ふいに力が溢れてきて自分の心が燃えるのを感じた。</p>
<p>「それはね」と彼は言った。その声は、またとても優しくそっと触れるような、ネコが脚でそっと触れるような、声というよりも感触だった。「その ―― 結婚してくださいって言いたかったんです」</p>

<p>マーチは彼の声を聞いたというよりも感じた。彼女は顔を背けようとしたができなかった。心の底からほっとした気持ちになったようだった。彼女は静かに立ち、心もち首を傾けた。彼は眼では見えない微笑みを浮かべながら、彼女の方に体を傾けているように思えた。彼から細かな火花が出てくるように思えた。</p>
<p>それから、まったくだしぬけに彼女は言った。</p>
<p>「馬鹿なこと言わないでちょうだい」</p>
<p>彼の神経に震えが走った。失敗したんだ。気を取り直すために、一瞬間待った。それから彼は言った。声に奇妙な優しさを込めて、あたかも気付かれないように彼女を愛撫しているようであった。</p>
<p>「違います。馬鹿なことじゃありません。馬鹿なことなんかじゃありませんよ。そう思っています。本気です。どうして僕の言うこと信じてくれないんですか」</p>
<p>彼は傷ついたような声を出した。その声には彼女を支配する奇妙な力があった。彼女の緊張をほぐし、リラックスさせる力だ。彼女は自分の力を取り戻そうと、心のどこかでもがいた。彼女は一瞬間もう、だめだと思った ―― だめだ ―― だめだ。自分が撃ち抜かれたかのように、その言葉は彼女の中で揺れた。いきなり、彼女はまた口を開いた。</p>
<p>「あなたは自分の言っていることが分からないのよ」と彼女は言った。一瞬だがほんの少し侮蔑を含んだ言い方だった。「何て馬鹿なこと！わたし、あなたのお母さんくらいの年なのよ」</p>
<p>「分かっていますよ。自分が何しゃべっているかくらい、分かっています」とやわらかな調子で言い張った。あたかも彼女の血の中に自分の声を送り出そうとしているかのようであった。「自分の言っていることはよく分かっています。あなたは僕の母親ほどの年じゃない。その点は間違っている。たとえそうでも、何が問題になるんです。僕たちの年齢がどうであろうと結婚はできる。僕にとっては年なんか問題じゃない。あなたにとっても同じだ！年齢は関係ない」</p>

<div><div><div><div><div><p><a href="#calibre_link-52">4-G</a><br /></p>
<p>彼がそう言い切ると、彼女はめまいを感じた。彼は早い口調で言った ―― コーンウォール訛りの早口だった ―― その声は、彼女の中の、どこなのか分からないが、それを待ち望む所で強く響いた。「年齢は関係ない」と彼の、やわらかだが、強く執拗に言い張る言葉を聞くと、マーチは暗闇のなかで自分の体がかすかに震えるのを感じた。彼女は返事ができなかった。</p>
<p>強烈な喜びが火のように、彼の体中をとび跳ねた。勝った、と感じた。</p>
<p>「結婚したいんです。分かるでしょう。なぜ結婚しちゃいけないんです？」彼はやわらかに、だが、早口で言った。彼は彼女の返事を待った。暗闇の中で彼女は燐光のように、かすかに光っているように見えた。彼女は瞼を伏せ、顔を半ば背けて何も意識していない。彼に支配されているようだった。しかし、彼は見詰めながら油断なく、待った。まだ彼女に触れようとしなかった。</p>
<p>「さあ、返事をして」と彼は言った。「結婚すると返事してください ―― 返事して！」彼はやわらかい調子だが執拗であった。</p>
<p>「何を？」と彼女は訊いた。遠く、かすかで、苦しんでいる者の声のようであった。今や彼の声は考えられぬほど近くでやわらかかった。彼は間近に迫って来た。</p>
<p>「結婚すると言って」</p>
<p>「言えないわ」彼女のむせぶ声はたよりなく、半分しか聞き取れず、意識が遠のき、苦しみながら死を待つ人の声であった。「どうしてそんなこと言えるの？」</p>
<p>「言えるさ」と彼はものやわらかに言った。そして顔を背けて、呆然とうなだれている彼女の肩に優しく手を乗せた。「言えるよ。言えるに決まってる。どうして、言えないなんて言うの？言える、言える」と、そっと彼は前かがみになって口と顎をその首に触れた。</p>

<p>「やめて！」彼女は、ヒステリーを起こしたかのように狂おし気な小さな叫びをあげ、身を引きながら彼の方をまともに見た。「何をするつもりなの！」だが声にはならなかった。まるで殺されたかのようであった。</p>
<p>「本当の気持ちを言っているんです」彼は静かだが、容赦なく言いつのった。「結婚してほしい。僕と結婚してほしいんだ。もう分かったでしょう？分かった？ねえ？分かった？」</p>
<p>「何が？」</p>
<p>「結婚してほしい、ということ」と彼は答えた。</p>
<p>「分かったわ」と彼女は言った。「あなたがそう言ってるのは分かったわ」</p>
<p>「僕が本気なことは分かったでしょう？」</p>
<p>「そう言ってることは分かった」</p>
<p>「僕の言ったことを信じる？」</p>
<p>彼女はしばらく黙った。それから唇を固く結んだ。</p>
<p>「自分が何を信じればいいのか分からない」と彼女は言った。</p>
<p>「そこにいるの？」家の中からバンフォードの呼んでいる声がした。</p>
<p>「ここにいますよ。家の中に薪を入れようとしているんです」と彼は答えた。</p>
<p>「あなたたち、行方不明になったのかと思ったわ」とバンフォードは気の滅入るような調子で言った。「急いでちょうだい。お茶にしましょう。お湯が煮えたぎっているのよ」<br /></p>

<p>彼はすぐに屈みこんで、小さな薪を一束抱えると台所に入り、隅の方に積んだ。マーチも両腕いっぱいになるまで薪を取り上げ、重い子どもでも運ぶように胸に抱きかかえながら入った。夜になり寒気が増した。<br /></p>
<p>薪を全部運び込むと、<a href="#calibre_link-511">ふたりは外の泥落としで音を立てながら長靴をきれいにした</a>あと、ドアマットで靴の裏をこすった。<a href="#calibre_link-512">マーチはドアを閉め、古いフェルト帽子を脱いだ ―― 農園の娘がかぶる帽子だ。</a>彼女の豊かで細かく縮れた髪はばらけて、その顔は緊張で青ざめていた。何となしにその髪を後ろへやると手を洗った。バンフォードは照明の落ちた台所に行き、<a href="#calibre_link-513">温めておいたスコーンをオーブンから取り出した。</a></p>
<p>「一体全体、これまで何をしていたの？」彼女はいらいらして訊いた。「あなたたち、もう二度と戻って来ないと思ったわよ。ずっと前に鋸を引くのは終わっていたでしょう。あそこで何をしていたの？」</p>
<p>「ああ」とヘンリーは言った。「ネズミが入らないように小屋の穴をふさいでいたんです」</p>

<p>彼らはお茶を飲みに居間に入った。マーチは一言も口をきかなかった。彼女は緊張のあまり青ざめ、はっきりしない表情だった。若者はいつもと変わらぬ赤ら顔で、自分の考えは外に出さないように、無表情であった。自宅であるかのようにワイシャツ姿のまま、お茶の食卓につくと、皿の上におおいかぶさるようにして食べた。</p>
<p>「寒くないの？」とバンフォードは悪意をこめて訊いた。「上着も着ないで」</p>
<p>彼は顎が皿につきそうなまま、彼女を見上げた。彼女を見詰める彼の眼はやけに澄んでいて透明だった。そして動揺しなかった。</p>
<p>「いや、寒くはありません」と彼はいつも通り、ものやわらかで礼儀正しく言った。「外よりも家の中はずっと暖かいですからね」</p>
<p>「それならいいけど」とバンフォードは、いらいらして言った。彼の奇妙な、慇懃ながら厚かましい態度や、眼を見開いた明るい表情が、今晩は彼女の神経にさわった。</p>
<p>「でも、おそらく」と彼はやわらかく丁寧な口調で言った。「上着を着てこないで食事に来たのがいけなかったということですよね。着るのを忘れたんです」</p>
<p>「いえ、かまわないわよ」とバンフォードは言った。だが実際には、彼女はそれを気にしていた。</p>
<p>「着てきましょうか？」と彼は言った。</p>
<p>マーチの黒い眼がゆっくりと彼の方を向いた。</p>
<p>「わざわざ、そうすることはないわ」と彼女は奇妙な鼻声で言った。「そのままでいいと思うなら、そのままでいなさいよ」彼女の声はぞんざいで命令口調だった。</p>
<p>「そうですね」と彼は言った。「不作法でなければこのままでいたいです」</p>
<p>「ふつうは不作法とみなされているのよ」とバンフォードは言った。「でもまあ、わたしたちは気にしないけれど」</p>
<p>「よしてよ、『不作法とみなされている』なんておかしいわ」とマーチが不意に激しい調子で言った。「だれが不作法だなんて思うの？」</p>
<p>「まあ、意外だわね、ネリー。他の人のことならあなたもそう思うでしょう？」とバンフォードは言った。眼鏡の奥には少しばかり怒りが現われ、喉に食べ物がくっつくのを感じた。</p>

<p>しかし、マーチは、ふたたびどちらつかずの態度になって、無関心なまま、食事をしていることをまったく忘れたかのように食べ物を噛んでいた。若者は、輝いた油断のないまなざしをふたりにかわるがわる送っていた。</p>
<p>バンフォードは腹を立てた。大体この若者は、慇懃で礼儀正しくやわらかな声で話すにもかかわらず、彼女に対して無礼なのだ。顔も見たくなかった。彼の澄んだ油断のない眼にあいたくなかった。彼の顔の奇妙な輝きを、繊細で細かなうぶ毛の生えた頬を見たくなかった。さえないが、奇妙な、生命の火が燃えるような赤味を帯びた皮膚を見たくなかった。彼を見ていると、少し気分が悪くなった。目の前にある彼の肉体はあまりにも無遠慮で情熱がありすぎた。</p>
<p>お茶のあとの晩はとても静かだった。若者はめったに村に行かず、たいてい本を読んでいた。自分が自由にできる時間にはよく読んだ。つまり、読みはじめれば没頭した。だが、いつも本にばかり向かうというわけではなかった。<a href="#calibre_link-206">夜になって暗くなると、しばしばひとりで牧草地のあたりや生垣に沿って歩いた。</a>夜行性動物のような奇妙な本能を持ち、うろつきながら野性の世界の音に耳を傾けていた。</p>

<p>しかし、今晩の<a href="#calibre_link-349">彼はバンフォードの書棚からメーン・リード大尉の本を取り出して</a>膝を大きく開けて座り、その物語に没頭した。彼の茶色がかった金髪は長く、横に撫でつけられて、厚地の帽子のように頭にのっていた。彼はまだ上着を着ないでいた。ランプの明かりの下で、前屈みになって膝を広げて突き出して、本を片手に持ち、全身、読書という根気のいることに没頭している姿のために、バンフォードの居間はまるで、樵人（きこり）小屋の観を呈した。彼女はこれが気にいらなかった。居間には赤い小さなトルコ製のじゅうたんを敷き、その周りに暗色の敷物を敷き、暖炉には流行のグリーンのタイルを使い、ピアノはふたを開けたままにして、そこには最新のダンス音楽の楽譜を置いていた。彼女はピアノが上手であった ―― 壁にはマーチが絵付けした白鳥とスイレンの絵皿がかかっている。さらに、外では吹きすさぶ風に松の木が音を立てて震えていても、暖炉の格子の内側では薪がきちんと並べられ、気持ちよく焔をゆらめかせて燃えていたし、厚地のカーテンは閉じられ、ドアというドアはすべて閉められて、居心地よく、洗練された素敵な空間だったのである。そこに大男が、太くて粗野な長い脚で、カーキ色の膝を突き出して座り、赤味がかった太い手首には兵士用シャツのカフスボタンをはめたシャツ姿でいるので彼女は腹立たしかったのである。時折、彼は頁をめくり、暖炉を鋭い眼で見て、薪の具合を直した。それから、また彼は、熱心に読書という孤独な作業に没入した。</p>

<p>バンフォードもまた、低い椅子に座って本を読もうとしていた、しかしふたりに挟まれて落ち着かなかった。体を動かし、周囲を見回し、風の音を聞いていた。そして、こっそりとふたりをそれぞれに見た。背もたれのまっすぐな椅子に座り、ぴったりしたズボンに包んだ膝を組んで、ゆっくりと丹念に編み物をしているマーチも目障りな存在であった。</p>

<p>「考えていることに1ペニー賭けるっていったのよ」とバンフォードは皮肉を込めて言った。<a href="#calibre_link-239">「そんなに難しいなら、2ペンス賭けるわよ」</a></p>
<p>若者はランプの下で、明るい、澄んだ目つきでじっと見詰めていた。</p>

<p>「無駄ではないと思ったのよ」とバンフォードが答えた。</p>

<p>「そうなんですか！」と彼はまじめに言った。「しかし、なぜ退屈なんですか」</p>
<p>「退屈じゃない人がいるかしら？」とバンフォードが言った。</p>
<p>「残念ですね」彼はまじめな調子をくずさなかった。</p>
<p>「ここで充実した時間を過ごせると思っているなら大間違いよ」とバンフォードは言った。</p>
<p>彼は長いことまじめな目つきで彼女を見た。</p>
<p>「そうですね」と彼は奇妙に若者らしい生真面目さで言った。「僕は十分充実していますよ」</p>
<p>「なら、よかったわ」とバンフォードは言った。</p>

<p>彼女は読書にもどった。彼女の細くて、腰のない髪には、まだ三十になってもいないのに、すでに白いものがたくさん見えた。若者は本に顔を落とさず、マーチの方に眼を向けた。彼女は唇を固く結び、編み物を丹念に続けていた。眼は大きく見開いていたが、視線はぼんやりしていた。暖かい感じの、色白のきめの細かな皮膚をしていて、鼻は繊細な形をしている。意地悪そうに固く唇を結んでいたが、その様子を打ち消すように黒い眉毛がアーチ形に高まり、大きな眼を見開いていた。それは不思議がったり、ぼんやりしたりする時の表情であった。夜の闇の中でさまよい、遠くへと去っていくキツネの声をふたたび聞こうと彼女は耳を澄ませていた。</p>
<p>ランプの光の輪の端から若者は顔を上げて、マーチを黙って見詰めていた。彼の眼は丸く、とても澄んで輝いていた。バンフォードはいらいらしながら爪を噛んで、顔にかかる髪の隙間から彼を盗み見た。彼はじっと座っていた。赤味がかった顔は、光の輪の端の、低い位置から見上げていた。そして放心していると言ってよいほどの熱心さでマーチを見詰めていた。彼女は突然、編み物から大きな黒い瞳を離して彼を見た。彼女はぎくりとして小さな叫びをあげた。</p>

<p>「そこにいるわ！」ひどく驚いたように、彼女は思わず叫んだ。</p>
<p>バンフォードは座り直すと、驚いてあたりを見回した。</p>
<p>「ネリー、一体どうしたっていうの？」と彼女は叫んだ。</p>
<p>しかし、マーチは頬をほんのりとバラ色に染めて、玄関の扉を見ていた。</p>
<p>「何でもない！何でもないの！」と彼女は不機嫌に言った。「口をきいたらいけないの？」</p>
<p>「いいわよ、でもちゃんと分かるように話してほしいわ」とバンフォードは言った。「いったい何を言いたいの？」</p>
<p>「何を言いたかったかなんて分からないわよ」とマーチは苛立たしげに言った。</p>
<p>「ネリー、あなた、神経がやられてないといいけれど。また、何か変なものが出てくるんじゃたまらないわ。だれのことを言っているの？ヘンリーのこと？」哀れにもおびえたバンフォードが言った。</p>
<p>「そうね。そうかも」とマーチは短く答えた。決してキツネのことは言わなかった。</p>
<p>「おお、いやだ、今晩は神経がおかしくなったわ」とバンフォードは泣き声を出した。</p>
<p>9時になると、マーチはパンとチーズと紅茶を盆にのせてもって来た ―― ヘンリーがお茶を飲みたいと言うのだ。バンフォードはミルクを1杯とパンを少し食べた。そしてすぐにこう言った。</p>
<p>「ネリー、寝室に行くわ。今晩は神経過敏になっているのよ。あなた、すぐ来るわね？」</p>
<p>「ええ、かたづけたらすぐ行くわ」とマーチは言った。</p>
<p>「ぐずぐずしないでね」いらつきながらバンフォードが言った。「ヘンリー、お休みなさい。あなたが最後なら、暖炉の後始末をよろしくね」</p>
<p>「はい、バンフォードさん、後始末しておきます」彼は安心させるように言った。</p>

<p>マーチは台所に行くためにロウソクに火をつけた。バンフォードも自分のロウソクを持って2階へ行った。マーチは暖炉の所に戻ってくると彼に言った。</p>
<p>「暖炉を消して万事後のことはお任せできるわね」片手を腰に当てて一方の足に体重をかけながら、恥ずかしそうに顔をそらした彼女がそこに立っていた。彼の顔を見ることができないようだった。彼は顔を上げて彼女を見た。</p>
<p>「ちょっとここに座って」と彼はやわらかく言った。</p>
<p>「だめよ。行かなきゃ。ジルが待っている。わたしが行かないと心配するわ」</p>
<p>「さっきどうしてあんなに跳び上がったの？」と彼は聞いた。</p>
<p>「いつわたしが跳び上がったの？」と彼を見ながら答えた。</p>
<p>「こいつは驚いた。さっきだよ」と彼は言った。「君が叫んだ時」</p>
<p>「ああ！」と彼女は言った。「あの時のこと！―― だって、あなたがキツネだと思ったのよ！」彼女の顔はゆがんで、半ば皮肉な、奇妙な微笑に変わった。</p>
<p>「キツネ！どうしてキツネなの？」と彼は優しく訊いた。</p>
<p>「なぜって、去年の夏、夕方にわたしが銃を持って出かけた時、足元近くの草むらにキツネがいてわたしをまともに見上げたの。分からないけど ―― そのキツネの印象が残っていたのかしら」彼女は、また、顔を背けた。照れくさそうに片足の力を抜いて動かした。</p>

<p>「いいえ、撃たなかったわ。<a href="#calibre_link-347">とてもびっくりしたのよ。わたしをまともに見て</a>、去って行く時立ち止まって、肩越しにわたしを見て笑ったの」</p>
<p>「笑った、だって？」ヘンリーも笑いながら繰り返した。「怖かったでしょう」</p>
<p>「怖かったわけではないの。印象付けられたのよ。それだけよ」</p>
<p>「それで、僕がキツネと思ったの？」彼は笑った。鼻にしわをよせ仔犬を思わせる、いつもの奇妙な、短くて小さな笑い方だった。</p>
<p>「そうよ、その瞬間そう思ったの」と彼女は言った。「たぶん気が付かないうちに、キツネがわたしの心に忍び込んだのね」</p>
<p>「たぶん僕が、君たちのニワトリか何かを盗みに来たと思ったんだね」彼は前と同じ、若者らしい笑い声で言った。</p>
<p>しかし、彼女は大きく見開いた、黒くて虚ろな眼で彼を見ただけであった。</p>
<p>「キツネと間違えられたのは初めてだ」と彼は言った。「ちょっと座りませんか」彼の声が、やわらかく、甘く誘った。</p>
<p>「だめよ」と彼女は言った。「ジルが待っているわ」しかし彼女は依然としてぐずぐずしていた。ちょうど光の輪の外側で、片足をゆるめて顔を背けて立っていた。</p>
<p>「僕の質問に答えてくれませんか？」彼はさらに声を低くした。</p>
<p>「どんな質問だか分からないわ」</p>
<p>「いや、分かっているはず。分かっているでしょう、もちろん。僕と結婚してくれませんか、という質問です」</p>
<p>「だめ、その質問には答えないわよ」と彼女はにべもなく言った。</p>
<p>「そうなの？」若者らしい、おかしな笑いが鼻の頭に現れた。「僕がキツネのようだからなの？それが理由？」彼は笑いが止まらなかった。</p>
<p>彼女はゆっくりと振り向いて、じっと彼を見た。</p>
<p>「そんなことで落第点をつけられては困るな」と彼は言った。「ランプの光を落として、ちょっとここに座わろうよ」</p>

<p>彼は赤味がかった手をランプの光の下に入れて、いきなり明かりを暗くした。マーチはその薄明りの中、影のように動かずに立っていた。彼は静かにその長い脚で立ち上がった。今や、彼のありえないほどのやわらかなささやき声は、ほとんど聞きとることができなかった。</p>
<p>「ほんのちょっと」と彼は言った。「ほんのちょっとだけ」そして彼女の肩に手を置いた。彼女は彼から顔を背けた。「本当は、僕がキツネのようだとは思っていないのでしょう」と彼は言った。その口調には前と同じやわらかさと、幾分かの笑いと、微妙な嘲りが含まれていた。「今も、そう思っているの？」彼は彼女を引き寄せて、優しく首すじにキスをした。彼女はひるみ、震え、そしてたじろいだ。しかし、若者の力強い腕は彼女を離さなかった。彼女が顔を背けていたので、また首すじにキスをした。</p>

<p>その瞬間、2階からバンフォードのいらいらしている不機嫌な呼ぶ声が聞こえた。</p>
<p>「ジルが呼んでいる！」ぎくりとして体をまっすぐに伸ばしながらマーチは叫んだ。</p>
<p>そうすると、彼は稲妻のように早く、すばやく彼女の唇にキスをした。かすめるような素早いキスだった。彼女の体のいたるところが燃えるようだった。彼女は奇妙な小さな叫びをあげた。</p>
<p>「結婚してくれるでしょう？してくれるね？」彼は優しいが執拗だった。</p>
<p>「ネリー、ネリー！どうしてぐずぐずしているの」バンフォードの消え入るような叫び声が、部屋の外の闇から聞こえて来た。</p>
<p>しかし、彼は彼女をしっかりと抱きしめた。そして前と変わらず、この上なくやわらかく、だが執拗にささやいた。</p>
<p>「結婚してくれるでしょう？ねえ、すると言って！すると言って！」</p>
<p>炎がマーチの体を通り抜け焦がしていった。彼女はこれ以上も何もできないかのようにつぶやいた。</p>
<p>「ええ！するわ！お好きなように！好きなようにすればいい！ただ、放してちょうだい！放して！ジルが呼んでいる」</p>
<p>「約束してくれましたね」と彼は、してやったりという風に言った。</p>
<p>「ええ！するわよ！そうします！」彼女の声は、突然、甲高い叫びとなった。「分かったわよ、ジル。すぐ行くわ」</p>

<p>翌朝、食事の前に家を見てまわり、貯蔵を調べて、自分がここに住む余裕はあると思った彼はバンフォードにこう切り出した。</p>
<p>「バンフォードさん、僕が何の話をするか分かりますか」</p>
<p>「さあ、何？」お人よしで、神経質なバンフォードは訊いた。</p>
<p>彼はマーチを見た。彼女はパンにジャムを塗っている。</p>
<p>「話していい？」彼は彼女に言った。</p>
<p>彼女は彼を見上げた。濃いピンク色に頬が染まった。</p>
<p>「ジルにならいいわ」と彼女は言った。「村で触れ回らなければいいわ。それだけ」彼女は乾いたパンをやっと飲み込んだ。</p>
<p>「一体、何の話かしら」とバンフォードは、疲れて少し充血した眼を見開いて見上げると、そう言った。彼女はやせて、ひ弱で、小柄であった。おかっぱで、痩せた褐色で白髪まじりの髪が、くたびれた顔に、弱々しくかかっていた。</p>
<p>「そうですね。何だと思いますか？」と彼は、秘密を持っている人のように微笑みながら言った。</p>
<p>「どうしてわたしが分かるのよ！」とバンフォードは言った。</p>
<p>「当ててみませんか」と彼は眼を輝かせて、微笑しながら満足気に言った。</p>
<p>「できないわ。その上、そうしたくもないし」</p>

<p>バンフォードは、細くて神経質な指からナイフを放した。食事を続ける気持ちはもうないかのように。彼女はうつろで赤くなった眼で見詰めた。</p>
<p>「あなたたちが、何をするって？」と彼女は声を上げた。</p>
<p>「僕たちは結婚するんですよ。ネリー、そうですよね？」と彼はマーチの方に顔を向けた。</p>
<p>「とにかく、あなたはそう言ってるわね」とマーチは、簡潔に言った。しかし、その顔はまた、苦しそうに赤くなっていた。彼女もそれ以上、食べ物が喉を通らなかった。</p>
<p>バンフォードは撃たれた小鳥のように彼女を見た。哀れな、病める小鳥のように。彼女は魂まで傷ついたことを顔一面に表して、真っ赤になったマーチを凝視した。</p>
<p>「まさか！」とバンフォードは力なく叫んだ。</p>
<p>「本当ですよ」と満足そうに顔を輝かせて若者は言った。</p>
<p>食卓の上の食べ物を見て気持ちが悪くなったかのように、バンフォードは顔を背けた。そのまましばらく病人のように座っていた。それから、片手で食卓の端を掴むと立ち上がった。</p>
<p>「ネリー、とても信じられないわ」と彼女は叫んだ。「絶対にありえない！」</p>
<p>彼女の悲しげな、いらいらした声には激怒と絶望の調子が混ざっていた。</p>

<p>バンフォードは、彼が博物館にある何かの生物の剥製でもあるかのように、大きく見開いたまま、ぼんやりした目つきで彼を見た。</p>
<p>「驚いたわ」と彼女はものうげに言った。「ネリーがそんな馬鹿とは思わなかったわ。そこまで自尊心を失うとは思わなかった」だれに言うでもなく、彼女の声は冷たく、悲しげであった。</p>
<p>「どうして自尊心をなくすことになるのですか」と若者は訊いた。</p>
<p>バンフォードは眼鏡の奥から、ぼんやりとだが、見据えるようにじっと見た。</p>
<p>「もう自尊心をもうとっくになくしているわね」</p>
<p>彼は、その眼鏡の奥の、ゆっくりと、ぼんやりした目つきで見られて、真っ赤になった。</p>
<p>「僕にはまったくそう見えないですが」</p>
<p>「多分、あなたにはそう見えないわね。あなたに分かるとは思えない」とバンフォードは言った。例のだれを責めるともない、遠回しで、おだやかな調子だったので、その分、彼にはその言葉が侮辱となって響いた。</p>
<p>彼は椅子に身をこわばらせて座っていた。真っ赤になった顔から、燃える青い眼で見詰めていた。額が醜くゆがんでいた。</p>
<p>「本当に、この人は、何に自分を追い込んでいるか分からないのよ」とバンフォードは悲しげな、だれに言うともない、侮辱する口調で言った。</p>
<p>「とにかく、あなたと何の関係があるんですか？」怒りを含ませて若者は言った。</p>
<p>「多分、あなたよりは関係があるわ」彼女は悲しげな、とげを含んだ口調で答えた。</p>
<p>「へえ、そうですか！どういうことだかまったく分かりませんね」と吐き出すように彼は言った。</p>
<p>「そう、あなたには分からないでしょうね」彼女は誰に言うともなく答えた。</p>
<p>「とにかく」マーチは、椅子を後ろに引いてぎごちなく立ち上がりながら言った。</p>
<p>「議論していても仕方がないわ」彼女はパンとティーポットを取ると、大股で台所に向かった。</p>

<p>ヘンリーはむっとしながら、固くなったまま椅子に座っていた。その顔と眼は怒りで燃え上がっていた。マーチは行ったり来たりしては食卓をかたづけているが、ヘンリーはあいかわらず、怒りで体をこわばらせて座ったままであった。彼は彼女の方を見向きもしなかった。彼女は落ち着きを取り戻し、穏やかな、むらのないクリーム色の顔色に戻っていた。しかし彼女の唇は固く結ばれていた。食卓から物をかたづける度に、その大きな、好奇心で満ちた眼で彼をちらりと見た。ほかに理由もなく、たんなる好奇心からであった。長身で、赤ら顔のむっつりとした若者！ただそれだけの男だ。彼は彼女とは関係ないようだった。彼の赤ら顔は牧草地の向こうの農家の赤レンガの煙突のようで、自分とは遠い存在だ。彼女は彼を突き放して、自分とは関係ない遠い存在として見ていた。</p>
<p>とうとう彼は立ち上がると、銃を持って牧草地に大股で出て行った。昼食まで戻って来なかった。顔には依然として怒りが現われていたが、物腰は極めて丁重だった。だれも特に口をきかなかった。それぞれ食卓で三角形の頂点に座り、頑なに押し黙っていた。午後になると、彼はまた銃を持って出かけて行き、日暮れに野ウサギ1匹と山鳩1羽をさげて帰って来た。そして夜は家から出なかったが、ほとんど口をきかなかった。彼はひどく怒っていた。侮辱されたと感じていたのだ。</p>

<p>バンフォードの眼は赤かった。彼女が泣いていたのは明らかだった。しかし、彼女の態度はこれまでになくよそよそしく傲慢であった。彼が少しでも話すと、あたかも彼が浮浪者か、その種の闖入者であるかのように顔を背けるので、彼の青い眼は怒りでどす黒くなった。彼の顔は前よりも不愛想になったが、話す時の丁寧な調子は忘れなかった。この雰囲気のなかで、マーチは生き生きとしてきたようだった。顔には意地の悪い微笑が浮かび、敵対するふたりの間に座って楽しんでいるようだった。その晩、根気よく編み物をしている姿には満足している様子さえ見えた。</p>
<p>若者は、寝ようとした時、ふたりが寝室で言い合いをしている声を耳にした。起き上がって、彼女たちが何を話しているのか聞こうと耳を澄ませた。話の内容は聞こえない。あまりにも遠すぎた。だが、バンフォードの静かで悲しげな、ぶつぶついう声と、マーチの一段と低い声は聞きとることができた。</p>

<p>彼はこっそりベッドから抜け出して、自分の部屋のドアのところに立った。前と同じく聞こえなかった。細心の用心をしながらドアの掛金を上げた。かなりしてからドアを開け、忍び足で廊下に出た。足元の古いカシの板は冷たく、驚くような軋む音を立てる。一足、一足毎、そおっと壁に沿って静かに進み、彼女たちの寝室のドアの前に立った。そこで息を殺して耳を傾けた。バンフォードの声が聞こえる。</p>
<p>「だめ、どうしても我慢ができないわ。ひと月も経たないうちに、わたし、死んでしまうわ。もちろん、あの男の狙いはそれなのね。わたしが墓地に埋められるのが彼の狙いなのよ。ネリー、もし彼と結婚するなんていう馬鹿な真似をしたら、あなた、ここにはいられないのよ。わたしは彼とは一緒に住めないわ。ああ、いやだ！―― あの男の服の臭いをかぐだけで気分が悪くなる。あの赤ら顔を見るだけで頭がおかしくなるわ。一緒に食事すると食べ物が喉を通らない。あの男を家に泊めるなんてわたしは何て馬鹿だったんでしょう。ほんと、親切心など持っちゃいけないのね。ブーメランのように戻ってきて顔にぶつかるからね」</p>

<p>「あのひとにここに来ないでと言いましょうよ。そう言いましょう」とマーチが言った。</p>
<p>「まあ、あなたは気にしなくてもいいのよ。わたしがそう言うつもりだし、彼が出て行く前に他のことも言うわ。わたしに口をきく力が残っている限り彼の好きなようにはさせない。大変よ、ネリー、あの男はあなたが自分の言いなりになると、あなたを軽蔑するわ、軽蔑するわよ。あいつのようなつまらない人でなしは、そうするものよ。わたしはあの男を信用しないわ、泥棒猫を信用しないのと同じこと。腹黒くって隠し事が好きなやつ、それにボス風を吹かせる、頭のてっぺんから足のつま先まで欲のかたまりよ。冷たいのは氷と同じ。あいつの狙いはあなたを食い物にするだけ。あなたがあいつにとって役に立たなくなれば、あなたは哀れにも捨てられることになるわ」</p>

<p>それから彼は長靴とコートを身に着け、銃を手に取った。農園を離れる考えなど毛頭なかった。出ていくものか、彼は銃を持っただけだった。できるだけ静かにドアの掛金をはずして、12月の霜夜に出た。風はなく、星は輝き、松の木は空に音を立てて逆立つようだった。忍び足で柵沿いに歩き、何か撃つものを探した。同時に、銃を撃って女たちを驚かすべきではないとも思った。</p>

<p><a href="#calibre_link-394">彼は腰を下ろして、開け放しになっている柵の出入口を長い間じっと見詰めていた。</a>そこにはささやかな光が、星からなのか、水平線からなのか分からないが、どこからか落ちていた。膝に銃を乗せて、暗い片隅の丸太に腰を下ろしていた。松の木々がパチパチという音を立てた。ニワトリが小屋の止まり木からどさりと落ち、けたたましく声を立て騒ぎが起こった。その音に驚いて彼は立ち上がった。眼をこらしてじっと見た。ネズミかも知れない。しかし、何事でもないだろうと彼は感じた。ふたたび腰を下ろすと銃を膝に置き、手を温めようと重ね合わせた。彼はまばたきしないで、青白い柵の出入り口の方を見詰めていた。冷たい空気の中に、生きたニワトリのむっとする、気持ちが悪くなる、強い臭いが漂っているのを感じた。</p>

<p>するとそのとき ―― 影が見えた。出入口の所を滑る影。彼は全視力を一点に集中させた。キツネの影が見えた。キツネは腹這いになって出入口を通って行く。蛇のように腹這いになって進んだ。若者は心のなかで、笑み、銃を肩に構えた。<a href="#calibre_link-325">彼には何が起こるかがよく分かった。キツネはニワトリ小屋の入口をふさぐ戸の所に行き、中にいるニワトリの臭いを嗅ぐだろう。</a>それから小屋の軒下をうろつき回り、中へ入り込むチャンスを待つだろう。</p>
<p>ニワトリ小屋の入口は緩やかな傾斜をのぼった端にある。影のようにそっと、キツネはこの傾斜を滑るように這い上がり、しゃがんで板戸に向かって鼻を伸ばした。その瞬間、すさまじい銃の発射音が古い建物をふるわせた。あたかも夜がこなごなに砕けたようであった。だが、若者は眼をこらして見詰めた。死んで足を投げ出した狐の白い腹も見た。彼は歩み寄った。</p>

<p>あたり一面で騒ぎが起こった。ニワトリはあわてふためき悲鳴を上げ、アヒルはガーガーわめきはじめて、小馬は荒々しく足を踏み鳴らした。しかし、キツネは横倒しになり、断末魔の痙攣をしていた。若者はその上にかがみ込み、キツネの臭いを嗅いだ。</p>
<p>2階で窓を開く音がして、それからマーチの声が呼びかけた。</p>
<p>「だれなの？」</p>
<p>「僕です」とヘンリーは言った。「キツネを撃ったんです」</p>
<p>「まあ！ びっくりしてわたしたち心臓が止まるところだったわ」</p>
<p>「驚いた？それはどうもごめんなさい」</p>
<p>「どうして起き出したの？」</p>
<p>「近くでキツネが鳴く声がしたんです」</p>
<p>「殺したの？」</p>
<p>「ええ、ここにいますよ」と若者は中庭に立った。まだ暖かい、死んだキツネを持ち上げた。「見えませんよね？ちょっと待ってください」彼はポケットから懐中電灯を取り出すとキツネを照らした。尾を持ってぶら下げた。暗闇のなか、赤味がかった毛と、白い腹と、とがった顎の下の白い斑点と奇妙にぶら下がった脚がマーチには見えた。彼女は言葉に詰まった。</p>

<p>「きれいなキツネですよ」と彼は言った。「あなたの素敵な毛皮の襟巻になるんじゃないかな」</p>
<p><a href="#calibre_link-233">「キツネの襟巻などしないわ」とマーチは答えた。</a><br /></p>
<p>「へえ！」と彼は言った。彼は電灯のスイッチをひねって消した。</p>
<p>「さあ、入って、また寝なさいよ」と彼女は言った。</p>
<p>「そうするつもりです。今何時ですか？」</p>
<p>「ジル、今何時なの？」というマーチの声が聞こえた。1時15分前であった。</p>
<p>その晩、マーチはまた夢を見た。バンフォードが死んだ夢だ。自分は心臓が張り裂けんばかりに泣いていた。それからバンフォードを棺に入れなければならなかった。台所のかまどのそばにある薪を入れておく粗削りの木の箱が彼女の棺桶だった。ほかに箱はなかった。マーチは苦しみ、うろたえ、困惑した。箱の内張りにするものはないか、やわらかになるように内張りにするものはないか、可哀そうな死んだ友を覆うものはないかと探した。白くて薄い寝間着だけのままで、殺風景な木箱に遺体を入れることはできなかった。それで、彼女は探し回り次から次に手あたり次第ひろい上げては捨てた。夢では思うようにはならず困り果てた。夢の中で絶望した挙句、見つけ出せたのはキツネの毛皮だけであった。これでは、ふさわしくないということは分かっていた。これは使うべきではない。だが、それしか見つけられなかった。キツネの尾をふたつに折って、いとおしいジルの頭の下に差し入れた。毛皮をぐるっとまわして遺体の上にかぶせた。そのせいで、赤味がかった、火のような色が全身を覆った。マーチはさんざん泣いて、眼が覚めた時には涙が頰を伝っていた。</p>

<p>マーチとバンフォードが朝起きて最初にしたことは、キツネを見に外にでることだった。ヘンリーが小屋のなかに後ろ足を縛ってつるしていたので、哀れな尾は後ろに垂れていた。それは今を盛りの立派な雄ギツネだった。見事な厚い、冬を越すための毛皮をつけていた。色はきれいな赤のまじった金色で、腹に向かって灰色が混じっていた。腹そのものは白く、太くてふさふさした尾は灰色と黒がうまい具合に混ざり、尾の端は純白であった。</p>
<p>「かわいそうに！」とバンフォードは言った。「悪さをしなければ哀れに思ってもらえただろうに」</p>
<p>マーチは何も言わなかった。片方の足を横に流し、反対側の腰を突き出す格好で立っていた。顔は青ざめ、大きくて黒い眼は、逆さつるされている死んだキツネを見ていた。その腹は、雪のように白くやわらかだ ―― 雪のように、白くてやわらかい。彼女は手を差し伸べてそっとさすった。その黒く光る尾は太く、手ごたえがあり、立派だった。彼女は、それもなでてみた。そして震えた。何回も、太い尾の立派な毛皮を指で挟んでみた。そして手をゆっくりと下げていった。素晴らしい、鋭くて、太く、輝く尾。それなのにその命はもうない！彼女は口をきゅっと結んだ。その眼は暗くなり、ぼんやりした。それからキツネの頭を手で持ってみた。</p>

<div><div><div><div><div><p><a href="#calibre_link-187">8-B</a><br /></p>
<p>ヘンリーがぶらぶらとやって来たので、バンフォードは当てつけるように離れた。キツネの頭を手に持ったまま、マーチは考えにふけった。キツネの長い立派な鼻づらについていろいろと思いを巡らせた。<a href="#calibre_link-108">どうしてなのか分からないが、それはスプーンか細長いへらを連想させる</a>。不可解なものを感じるのだ。<a href="#calibre_link-109">この獣は不思議な生き物であり、彼女の理解が及ばない、知識の範囲を越えた存在であった。</a>素晴らしい銀色のあごひげをはやしている。まるで氷でできた糸だ。内側にも毛が生えている、とがった耳。それにも増して、引き延ばしたように細長いスプーンのような鼻！―― その下にのぞく素晴らしい白い歯！それを突き出して、生きている獲物をどこまでも深く噛み、血をすするのだ。</p>
<p>「美しいキツネでしょう？」と、ヘンリーがそばに立ちながら言った。</p>
<p>「そうね。立派で大きなキツネだわ。いったいニワトリを何羽食べたのかしら」と彼女は答えた。</p>
<p>「たくさん食べただろうね。君が夏に見たのと同じだと思う？」</p>
<p>「多分同じね」と彼女は答えた。</p>
<p>彼は彼女をじっと見詰めたが、彼女が何を考えているか分からなかった。ひとつには彼女は内気でうぶであったから。また、ひとつには、冷酷で、冷静で意地が悪かったから。彼女の言うことは、その大きくて見開いた奇妙な黒い眼の表情とは、ひどくそぐわないと彼には思えた。</p>

<p>「朝飯を終えてからね。釘づけにする板を用意するよ」</p>
<p>「まあ、何て臭いがひどいんでしょう！うーっ！手を洗わないと。手で触るなんて何と馬鹿だったんでしょう」そう言って彼女は腹から尾を触った自分の右手を見た。手には毛皮の黒い所を触った時についた血の小さな縞が見えた。</p>
<p>「狐の臭いを嗅いだ時に、どんなにニワトリが怖がるか、その様子を見たことがある？」と彼は言った。</p>
<p>「ええ、そりゃすごいわよね！」</p>
<p>「キツネの蚤にたかられないようにね」</p>
<p>「ああ、蚤ね！」彼女は無造作に答えた。</p>
<p>その日の遅く、キツネの皮が板に張り付けられた。それはまるで十字架を思わせた。彼女は不安になった。</p>
<p>若者は怒っていた。自分の顎の一部を飲みこんだかのように、口を固く閉じて歩きまわった。しかし、態度は礼儀正しく丁寧であった。自分が何をしようとしているかは話さなかった。マーチのことは放っておいた。</p>

<p>その晩、彼らは食堂に座っていた。バンフォードはもう彼を自分の居間に座らせなかった。暖炉には大きな薪が燃えている。3人とも忙しかった。バンフォードは手紙を書かねばならなかった。マーチはドレスを縫い、若者はなにか小さな装置を修理していた。</p>
<p>バンフォードは時折手紙を書く手を止め、あたりを見回して眼を休めた。若者は修理している物の上にかぶさっていたので、顔が見えなかった。</p>
<p>「そうだった」とバンフォードは言った。「ヘンリー、何時の列車で行くの？」</p>
<p>彼は顔を上げてまっすぐに彼女を見た。</p>
<p>「午前中の列車。午前中です」と彼は言った。</p>
<p>「どちらの列車かしら、8時10分？それとも11時20分？」</p>
<p>「11時20分かな」と彼は言った。</p>
<p>「明後日だったわね？」とバンフォードは言った。</p>
<p>「ええ、そうです」</p>
<p>「そう」とバンフォードはつぶやくと、手紙に戻った。だが、封筒をなめながら彼女は訊いた。</p>

<p>「あなたとネリーのことよ、このまま結婚に進むのならね。結婚式はいつなの？」彼女はあざける口調で言った。</p>
<p>「結婚式のことですか！」と彼は答えた。「分かりません」</p>
<p>「何も分からないですって？」バンフォードは言った。「金曜日に出て行って、今のままにしておくの？」</p>
<p>「ええ、どうしてそれが悪いんですか、手紙でやり取りができるでしょう？」</p>
<p>「もちろん、そうよ。でも訊いたのはこの農園のことがあるからよ。ネリーが突然結婚するなら、新しい同居人を探さなければならないわ」</p>
<p>「結婚しても彼女はここに住ませてもらえないのですか」と彼は言った。どのような返事かはよく分かっていた。</p>
<p>「残念ね」とバンフォードが言った。「ここは夫婦者が住むところじゃないわ。ひとつには男が生計を立てていけるような仕事がないのよ。お金も稼げないし。結婚してもここに住めると考えてはだめよ、絶対に！」</p>
<p>「分かりました。僕だってここにいようとは思っていないです」と彼は言った。</p>
<p>「そう、わたしが知りたいのはそのこと。じゃあ、ネリーをどうするつもり？その場合、いつまで彼女の方は、わたしと一緒にここにいるの？」</p>

<p>敵対するふたりは互いに相手を見詰めた。</p>
<p>「それは分かりません」と彼は答えた。</p>
<p>「まあ、馬鹿なことは言わないで」彼女は怒って声を荒げた。「女性に結婚を申し込むならどうするかぐらいは考えているものよ。悪ふざけなら別だけれど」</p>
<p>「悪ふざけじゃない。僕はカナダに戻るんです」</p>
<p>「彼女も連れて？」</p>
<p>「ええ、その通りですよ」</p>
<p>「ネリー、聞いた？」とバンフォードは訊いた。</p>
<p>縫物の上にかがみこんでいたマーチが鮮やかなピンク色に染まった顔を上げると、眼と歪んだ口元には奇妙な冷笑が浮かんでいた。</p>
<p>「わたしがカナダに行こうとしていたなんて初めて聞いたわ」</p>
<p>「そうだね、初めて話すわけだもの」と青年は言った。</p>
<p>「そうよ、初めてだと思うわ」と彼女は平然と言い放つと、ふたたび縫物に戻った。</p>
<p>「カナダに行く覚悟はできているの、ネリー？そうなの？」とバンフォードは訊いた。</p>
<p>マーチはまた顔を上げた。肩の力を抜き、針を持った手を膝の上にゆるめた。</p>
<p>「どうやって行くかが問題よ」と彼女は言った。「兵士の妻として3等船室にすし詰めじゃいやだわ。そんな旅には慣れていないからね」</p>

<p>「まず僕が先に行くから、ここにいてくれませんか」と彼は訊いた。</p>
<p>「ほかに方法がなければそうするわ」と彼女は答えた。</p>
<p>「それが一番賢いやり方よ。はっきりした約束はしちゃだめ」とバンフォードは言った。「ヘンリーが戻って住む場所を探してから、行くか行かないか、を決めなさいよ、ネリー。それ以外は正気の沙汰じゃないわ、馬鹿げてる」</p>
<p>「こういうのはどう？」と若者は言った。「僕が行く前に結婚するんだ ―― それから一緒に行くか、もしくは別々に行くかにしたら？事情によるけど」</p>
<p>「とんでもないわ」とバンフォードは叫んだ。</p>
<p>しかし、若者はマーチをじっと見詰めていた。</p>
<p>「あなたはどう思う？」と彼は訊いた。</p>
<p>マーチはぼんやりと虚空を眺めていた。</p>
<p>「そうね、分からないわ」と彼女は言った。「考えなければと思う」</p>
<p>「どうして？」当然のことながら彼は訊いた。</p>
<p>「どうしてって？」彼女の頬には赤味がさしていたが、あざけるように彼の質問をおうむ返しに言うと、笑いながら彼を見た。「理由はたくさんあるんじゃないかしら」</p>

<p>彼は黙って彼女を見詰めた。彼女は彼から逃げてしまったようだ。バンフォードと組んで彼を敵に回したのだ。彼女の顔にふたたび奇妙な冷笑的な表情が見えている。彼が言うことや日常生活で起こるどんなことも冷たくあざけることが彼女にはよくあった。</p>
<p>「もちろん」と彼は言った。「あなたが望まないことを無理強いはしない」</p>
<p>「まったくの話、望まないと思うわよ」バンフォードの声は怒っていた。</p>
<p>床に就く時になると、バンフォードは哀れっぽくマーチに言った。</p>
<p>「ネリー、湯たんぽを持ってきてくれない？」</p>
<p>「ええ、いいわよ」マーチは、いとおしい、だが気まぐれなジルに向かってしばしば示す、したいのか、したくないのかよく分からない調子で言った。</p>

<p>翌日、ヘンリーは額にしわを寄せ、若者らしい顔を固くこわばらせて歩きまわっていた。その間ずっと考え込んでいた。マーチが自分と結婚して、一緒にカナダへ行ってくれることを彼は願ってきた。そうなるだろうと信じていた。なぜ彼女と結婚したいのかは自分でもよく分からなかったが。それでも、彼は本当に結婚したかった。彼女に決めていた。それなのに邪魔されて、若者らしい怒りで身もだえした。邪魔された！邪魔された！心の中は怒りでいっぱいになり、自分でもどうしたらよいか分からなかった。しかし抑えていた。今からでも事態はよい方に動くかも知れないからだ。彼女の気持ちは自分に向いて動くはずだ。もちろんそうなる。そうするのが彼女の義務だもの。</p>
<p>夕方になるとふたたび緊張が高まってきた。彼とバンフォードは日中、互いに相手を避けていた。実際、バンフォードは11時20分の列車で小さな町に行ってしまった。<a href="#calibre_link-438">市の立つ日だったのである。</a>4時25分の列車で彼女は戻って来た。ちょうど夜になろうとした頃、<a href="#calibre_link-439">ヘンリーはダークブルーのコートとベレー帽子を身に着けたバンフォードの小柄な姿が、駅の方からやって来て最初の牧草地を横切っていくのをみとめた。</a>彼は野生のナシの木の下で枯葉を踏みながら立って、荒れた冬景色の牧場を何物も恐れぬように進んで来る小柄な青い人影をじっと見詰めていた。両腕にいっぱい袋を抱えて、ゆっくりと進んで来る。弱々しいが、恐ろしいほど確信に満ちた歩きぶりだ。それが彼女のなかでたまらなくいやなところだった。彼はナシの木の下で、見つからないように立って彼女の一足一足をじっと見詰めていた。<a href="#calibre_link-440">彼の形相が彼女に影響を与えることができるなら、こちらに向かってくる彼女の足取りは、足首に鉄でできた丸太が結わえられたように重くなっただろう。</a>「けちな小女」と彼は遠くから、小さな声で言った。「けちな、小女め。おまえが理由もないのに僕にしてきた悪事すべてに仕返ししてやるから。いやらしいちびめ、そうしてやるから。報いを受けるぞ。僕の願いが叶えられるものならば、そうなるからな。この、いやらしいちびめ」</p>

<p>「ああ、お似合いだね」彼は小声で夕闇に向かって言った。「菊の束なんか持ってとぼとぼ歩くなんておまえにはお似合いだよ。そんなに固く抱きしめていたいなら、お茶の代わりに食べさせてやるよ。それでも足りなければ、朝食の代わりにも食べさせてやる。おまえには花しかやらないよ。皿にのっているのは花だけだ」</p>

<p>「どうして荷物をわたしに預けてから登らないの？」</p>
<p>その声にはどこか奇妙に悲しげな非難の調子がある。するとマーチは元気で無頓着な口調で答えた。</p>
<p>「あら、大丈夫よ。わたしのことは心配しないで。あなたは乗り越えることだけに全力を使えばいいのよ」</p>

<p>「傷ついてなんかいないわよ」とマーチは言った。</p>

<p>「自分をおとしめたことなどないわよ」とマーチは言った。</p>
<p>「おとしめていないと言うのなら、あの生意気で恥知らずのやつがあなたを馬鹿扱いにしているのを、どう言ったらよいか分からないわ。自分のことをどう思っているの。これから先、あいつがあなたのことを、少しでも尊敬するとでも思っているの？<a href="#calibre_link-60">誓って言うけれど、あの男と結婚するなら同じ靴をはかないわ</a>」</p>
<p>「もちろん、そういうことにはならないでしょうね。わたしの靴は、あなたにはちょっと大き過ぎるし、まったく上品でないし」マーチは的外れながら皮肉をこめて言った。</p>
<p>「あなた、そんなに卑下すると思わなかった、本当にそうよ。女性は高姿勢でいるべきだわ。とくにあんな若造に対しては。分かるでしょう？あいつは生意気なのよ。初めから、わたしたちのところに押し入った時のやり方で分かるわ」</p>
<p>「泊まれと言ったのはわたしたちの方よ」とマーチは言った。</p>
<p>「彼が無理に頼まなければ、そうならなかったわ。それなのに、なんであんなに鼻が高くて生意気なの。まったくね、わたしに逆らうとは。どうしてあなたが、あいつに自分を軽く扱わせておくのか分からないわ」</p>
<p>「軽く扱われていると思わない」とマーチは言った。「心配しないで。だれもわたしを軽く扱わないから。あなただってわたしをそう扱えないわ」彼女の声には優しいが、挑む調子と、わずかながら怒りが現われていた。</p>

<p>ふたりは黙ってハリエニシダの茂みを抜けて、草の生えた急斜面を登り、高台に出た。若者は生垣の反対側沿いに、夕闇の中を、少し距離をおいて女たちの後についていった。時折、<a href="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX">木のように大きくなっているサンザシの茂み</a>から、ふたつの黒い影が丘を這うように登って来るのが見える。斜面の天辺に立ったら、夕闇の中に家の薄暗い影が見えた。巨大なナシの古木が、近くの切妻屋根から乗り出すように傾いている。台所の横窓には小さな黄色の明かりがまばたいていた。掛金のかちっとなる音が聞こえ、ふたりの女が入ると、台所の入口が明るくなった。家についたのだ。</p>
<p>そうだったのか！―― 彼女たちは自分をこんな風に思っていたのか。自分は人の話に耳を傾ける性分だ。だから何を聞いても驚かない。人が自分の性格について言っていることは、いつも的はずれだ。ただ、女たちが互いにあんな風にやり合うものかという点では驚いた。あんなことを言うバンフォードがひどく憎らしかったが、あのような考えのマーチには惹かれた。抵抗できないほど惹かれた。自分と彼女の間には秘密のつながり、秘密の糸がある。それは何か排他的なもので、他人を除外し彼女と自分だけを秘密に結びつけているものであった。</p>

<p>彼はふたたび彼女が自分を求めることを望んだ。彼女がすぐに結婚してくれるだろうと考えると、突然血が沸き立った。クリスマスが一番よい。クリスマスは遠くない。ほかの何が起ころうとも、彼女をつかまえ、急いで結婚してベッドを共にするのだ。先のことは、その後ふたりで取り決めることができる。ただ、願うように事が運ぶことを期待した。今晩バンフォードが2階に上がった後、彼女にしばらく残っていてほしかった。彼女のやわらかい、すべすべした頬に触ることができればと思った。あの奇妙な、驚いた表情の顔に触ろう。驚いたように大きく見開かれた瞳を覗き込もう。すぐ近くで。彼女の胸に手を置こう。上着の下のやわらかな乳房に触ろう。それを考えると、彼の心臓は奥底で激しく鼓動した。どうしてもそうしたかった。上着の下の乳房を確かめたい。彼女は首のところまで茶色のリンネルの上着のボタンをきっちりかけている。あの仕事着の下にやわらかな女性の胸をボタンできちんとめて隠しておかねばならないのは、それが彼にとって危険な秘密のようなものに思えた。やわらかなブラウスと絹モスリンのドレスの下にあるバンフォードの乳房よりも、上着の下に閉じ込められたマーチの胸はずっとやわらかく、敏感で、もっと美しく、愛らしく思われた。バンフォードのような女は小さな鉄の胸を持っているだろうよ。あの弱々しく、いらいらしていて、ひ弱なくせに、あいつの胸はちっぽけな鉄でできてるさ。マーチには、あの飾り気のない、身体にぴったりした労働者用の上着の下にやわらかで白い乳房があるだろう。それは白くて、だれにも見られたことがないものだ。彼は、そう自分に言い聞かせると血を沸き立たせた。</p>

<p>お茶を飲みに部屋に入ると彼は意外な光景を見て驚いた。いつものように顔を突き出し、ドアの内側のところに姿を見せ、足を踏みだす前に、ためらいながらも鋭い目つきで、部屋の中を用心深く見回すと、みるみるうちに顔は赤らみ、生き生きとして、青い眼は輝いた。彼は長袖の上着を着ていた。<a href="#calibre_link-381">彼の顔は、野外の者が屋内に入って来たかのようなとんでもない様相だった。ヒイラギの実がそのまま中に入って来たようだ。</a>入口で立ち止まった瞬間、ふたりの女性が食卓の反対の端に座っているのに気付き、眼を凝らして見た。彼はびっくりした。マーチが、くすんだ緑色の絹のクレープ地のドレスを着ていたのだ。驚いて彼は口をあけたままだった。彼女が突然ひげを生やしたとしても、こんなには驚かなかったろう。</p>
<p>「びっくりしたよ」と彼は言った。「ドレスを着たの？」</p>
<p>彼女は真っ赤になった顔を上げ、口元をゆがめて微笑んだ。</p>
<p>「もちろんそうよ。ドレス以外に何を着ると思うの？」</p>
<p>「制服があるじゃないか」と彼は言った。</p>
<p>「まあ！」と彼女は何気ない風に声を上げた。「ここの泥だらけの汚れ仕事をするにはそれが一番ね」</p>
<p>「じゃ、あれが普段の服装じゃないんだね」と彼は訊いた。</p>

<p>「そうよ。家の中では着ないわ」と彼女は言った。しかし彼のカップにお茶を注ぐあいだ彼女の顔はずっと赤かった。彼は席に着いても、彼女から眼を離すことができなかった。彼女のドレスは青緑色のクレープ地の、ごく簡素なスリップで、襟元と肘までの袖のまわりに金色の縫い取りがあり、ネックラインは単純に丸くくり抜かれていて、彼女の白い、やわらかな喉を見せていた。彼女が腕まくりしているのを何度か見たことがあったので、その腕が、たくましくて固い筋肉質であることを知っていた。だが、彼は彼女の頭のてっぺんから足のつま先まで見ていた。一方、バンフォードは食卓の反対側に座って一言も口をきかなかった。ただ皿の上のサーディンをいじっている。彼はバンフォードの存在をまったく忘れ、じっとマーチを見詰めながら、ただマーガリンをつけたパンをほおばっていた。お茶を飲むのも忘れている。</p>
<p>「本当だね、こんなに違うものとは知らなかったよ！」口をもぐもぐさせながら彼は言った。</p>
<p>「あら、やだ！」とさらに顔を赤らめてマーチは声を上げた。「わたし、顔の赤いおサルさんみたいね！」</p>

<p>彼女は急いで立ち上がってティーポットを暖炉の湯沸かしのところに持って行った。グリーンのスリップの裾を広げて暖炉のところでしゃがんだ時、若者は前よりも眼を大きく開けて見詰めた。クレープ地を通してマーチの体はやわらかく、女らしく見えた。立ち上がって歩くと、モダンな短いスカートの下で脚がやわらかく動くのが見えた。黒い絹の靴下をはき小さな金のバックルのついた小さなエナメルの靴をはいている。</p>
<p>違う。まったく違う人間だ。まったく違ってしまった。いつもは、鎧のように頑丈なごわごわした生地で、腰のところが太くて膝にボタンがあるズボンに、茶色のゲートルと厚いブーツをはいていたので、彼女が女らしい脚を持っているなんて思いもよらなかった。今、分かった。彼女は女性のやわらかな、スカートに包まれた脚をしている。今の彼女なら手が届く。彼は髪の毛の根元まで赤くなった。カップに鼻先を突っ込みバンフォードにいやがられる音をたてながらお茶を飲んだ。奇妙なことに、彼は突然、自分が若者ではなくて大人、それも責任という重いものを担った大人になった感じがした。奇妙な静寂さと厳粛な気持ちが魂を包んだ。自分は大人になったんだ、男の運命という重荷を少し担いでいる大人だ、平静でいなければならない、と感じた。</p>
<p>ドレス姿の彼女なら、やわらかくて手が届く。その思いが体の中心まで、永遠の責任のようにしみ込んだ。</p>

<p>「お願いだから、だれか何か言ってちょうだいな」とバンフォードがいらいらして言った。「お葬式みたいだわ」若者が彼女を見ると、バンフォードは顔を背けた。</p>
<p>「葬式ですって！」とマーチは口元をゆがめて微笑した。「困ったわ。そうだとわたしの夢が壊れるわ」</p>
<p>突然、彼女は棺桶代わりの木箱に入ったバンフォードを思い出した。</p>
<p>「まあ、結婚式の夢を見ていたの？」バンフォードが皮肉ぽく言った。</p>
<p>「そうだったかも知れない」とマーチ。</p>
<p>「だれの結婚式？」と若者は訊いた。</p>
<p>「思い出せないわ」とマーチは言った。</p>
<p>その晩はドレスを着ていたので彼女の態度は制服の時よりも落ち着いていたが、恥ずかしがって、ぎごちなかった。自分が皮をむかれて人目にさらされた感じだった。はしたないとさえ思った。</p>

<p>彼らはヘンリーの翌朝の出発についてとりとめのない話をし、ちょっとした打ち合わせをした。しかし、心に思っていることについて口にする者はいなかった。今晩の彼らはむしろ穏やかで友好的であった。バンフォードは話という話はしなかった。だが、心のなかでは落ち着き、ことによると好意的だった。</p>
<p>9時にはマーチが、いつものお茶と、バンフォードが何とかして手に入れたわずかなコールドミートを盆に乗せて持って来た。一緒に取る夕食はこれで最後だったので、バンフォードは彼にとって不愉快なものにしたくなかった。彼女は若者に対して少し気の毒に感じ、できるだけ親切にしようとした。</p>
<p>若者はバンフォードを寝室に行かせたかった。いつもなら彼女が最初に行く。だが、彼女はランプの下で椅子に座ったままだ。時折、本を見て、また暖炉を覗き込んでいる。部屋は針の落ちる音も聞こえるかのように静まった。その静けさを破ったのはマーチであった。かなり低い調子で言った。</p>
<p>「ジル、何時かしら」</p>
<p>「10時5分過ぎよ」とバンフォードは手首に目を落としながら言った。</p>

<p>そのあと、また静かになった。若者は膝の上に置いた本から眼を上げた。彼のいくぶん幅の広い、猫のような顔には頑固な表情が浮かび、彼の眼は油断なく光っている。</p>
<p>「もう寝てはどうかしら？」とマーチがとうとう言った。</p>
<p>「あなたがよければわたしはいつでも」とバンフォードは言った。</p>
<p>「分かったわ」とマーチは言った。「湯たんぽつくるわね」</p>
<p>彼女は言葉通りにそうした。湯たんぽの用意ができると、ロウソクに火をつけ、それをもって2階に行った。バンフォードは椅子に座ったままで聞き耳を立てていた。マーチはまた下りて来た。</p>
<p>「用意ができたわよ」と彼女は言った。「寝室に行きましょう」</p>
<p>「すぐに」とバンフォードは言った。だが、時間が過ぎても、彼女はランプ下の椅子に座ったままだった。</p>
<p>ヘンリーの瞳は上目づかいで猫のように輝き、その顔は広くなり、ますます丸ぽちゃで猫の顔のようになり、そこにてこでも動かぬ頑固さが現われた。彼は立ち上がると、いちかばちかの賭けに出た。</p>
<p>「雌ギツネがいるか探しに行くよ。このあたりをうろうろしているかも知れない。ネリー、ちょっと来ませんか。いるかいないか見てみよう」</p>
<p>「わたしが！」マーチは声を上げると訝しげな表情を顔に浮かべた。</p>
<p>「そうだよ。さあ、行こう」と彼は言った。なんて彼の声はやわらかく、暖かく、なだめて説き伏せるようであったことか。それもこんなに近くで。その声を聞いただけでバンフォードの血は煮えくりかえった。「ちょっとだけ来て」と彼は疑わしげな表情のマーチの顔を見下ろしながら言った。</p>

<p>彼女はその見下ろしている若い赤味を帯びた顔に引き寄せられるように立ち上がった。</p>
<p>「ネリー、夜のこんな時間に外に行くんじゃないでしょうね」とバンフォードは叫んだ。</p>
<p>「分かるよ、でもほんの少しだ」と若者はバンフォードの方を向いて、奇妙に鋭く吠えるような声を出した。</p>
<p>マーチはふたりをかわるがわる見た。困り果て、どうしたらよいか分からない表情だった。バンフォードは立ち上がって戦う姿勢を見せた。</p>
<p>「驚いたわ。馬鹿げたこと。外はとても寒いのに。そんな薄いドレスで出たら風邪をひいて死んでしまうじゃない。それに上履きのままで。そんなことをしちゃだめよ」</p>
<p>一瞬間、誰も黙った。バンフォードは小さな軍鶏のように構え、マーチと若者に顔を向けた。</p>
<p>「心配することはないよ」と彼は答えた。「星空の下にちょっといるくらいなら体に害はないよ。食堂のソファから毛布を取って持って行きますから。ネリー、来て」</p>
<p>バンフォードに向かって言った言葉には怒りと軽蔑と激怒が表れていたが、マーチに向かって言った言葉には優しさと、誇りと権威がこめられていたのでマーチは答えた。</p>
<p>「ええ、行くわ」</p>

<p>部屋の真ん中に立っていたバンフォードは突然わっと泣き出すと、その泣き声は長く尾を引き、そしてすすり泣きの発作になった。哀れな細い手で顔を覆い、弱々しい肩は悲痛な泣き声とともに震えていた。マーチは入口のところで振り返った。</p>
<p>「ジル！」彼女の声は危険に気付いた人の叫びに似た、取り乱したものだった。愛する者に向かって駆け出しそうに見えた。</p>
<p>しかし、若者がマーチの腕をつかんでいたので、彼女は動くことができなかった。彼女は自分がなぜ身動きができないのか分からなかった。心臓が緊張し、体が動かない夢を見ているようだ。</p>
<p>「心配しないで」若者は優しく言った。「泣かせておいて。泣くままにさせておこう。遅かれ早かれ彼女は泣かなきゃならないんだ。涙が出ることで気が楽になる。彼女のためによいことなんだ」</p>
<p>そう言いながら彼はゆっくりとマーチを引っ張って戸口を通り抜けた。彼女が最後に振り返って見たものは部屋の真ん中に立ち、顔を覆い、悲しんで泣きながら痩せた肩を震わせている、哀れな小さい姿だった。</p>

<p>食堂で彼はひざ掛けをつかみながら言った。</p>
<p>「これで体を包んで」</p>
<p>彼女は言うことを聞いた ―― ふたりは台所の出口に着いた。彼は彼女の腕を優しく、しっかりとつかんでいたが、彼女はつかまれていることに気が付かなかった。外の闇を見た時、彼女はぎくりとして尻込みした。</p>
<p>「ジルのところに戻らなくては」と彼女は言った。「戻らなければ！そうよ、そうしなければならないの」</p>
<p>彼女の口調は断固としていた。若者が腕を放してしまうと、彼女は部屋の中に向かった。しかし、彼はふたたび彼女をつかんで動けないようにした。</p>
<p>「ちょっと待てよ」と彼は言った。「ちょっと待って。行くにしろ今はだめだよ」</p>
<p>「放して！行かせてよ！」と彼女は叫んだ。「わたしの居場所はジルのそばなのよ。かわいそうに。胸が張り裂けたように泣いているわ」</p>
<p>「その通り」と若者はにがにがしく言った。「でも、あなたの心臓も、そして僕の心臓もそうなんだ」</p>
<p>「あなたの心臓ですって？」とマーチは言った。彼はまだ彼女の腕をつかみ動けないようにしていた。</p>
<p>「僕の心臓は彼女の心臓よりも劣っているの？」と彼は言った。「もしかして、そう思っているの？」</p>
<p>「あなたの心臓ですって？」と彼女は、信じられないように繰り返した。</p>
<p>「そう！僕の心臓ですよ、間違いなく！まさか僕には心臓はないと思っているんじゃないでしょうね？」しっかりと彼女の手を握り、それを自分の左の胸に当てた。「これが僕の心臓だ。僕にも心臓があるんですよ。ないと思っているかもしれないけれど」</p>

<p>驚異の念を感じて彼女はそこへ注意を向けた。彼の心臓の深い、重い、力強い鼓動を感じた。何か未知のところから来るもののように恐ろしかった。未知のところから来る、外からやって来る恐ろしいものが彼女に合図を送っている。その合図が彼女を麻痺させた。彼女の魂を打った。そして力を奪った。彼女はジルを忘れた。ジルのことをもはや考えることができなかった。彼女を考えることができなかった。あの外界から来る恐ろしい合図のせいだ！</p>
<p>若者は彼女の腰に腕をまわした。</p>
<p>「一緒に来て」と彼は優しく言った。「僕たちが話さなければならないことを話し合おう」</p>
<p>彼は彼女を外に連れ出してドアを閉めた。彼女は彼と一緒に暗い前庭の小道を行った。<a href="#calibre_link-436">この人に鼓動する心臓があるとは！</a>毛布の上から自分の体に腕をまわしているなんて！彼女はとても混乱したので、彼がだれで、何をしているのか考えることができなかった。</p>

<p>彼は彼女を小屋の暗い片隅に連れて行った。そこには長方形で低い、蓋のある道具箱があった。</p>
<p>「ちょっとここに座ろうよ」と彼が言った。<br /></p>
<p>言われるままに彼のそばに座った。<br /></p>
<p>「手を出して」彼は言った。<br /></p>
<p>彼女が両手を出すと、彼はそれを自分の両手で包み込んだ。彼は若く、そのせいで震えた。<br /></p>
<p>「結婚してくれるでしょう？帰国する前にそうしてくれるよね？」と彼は懇願した。<br /></p>
<p>「驚いたわ。わたしたちふたりとも馬鹿じゃないかしら」と彼女は言った。暗い中庭と植え込みの向こうにある母屋の明かりのついた窓が見えないように、彼は彼女を隅に座らせていた。小屋の中に自分と一緒に閉じ込めようとした。<br /></p>
<p>「どうして僕たちは馬鹿なの？」と彼は言った。「君が一緒にカナダに行ってくれれば、僕は仕事を見つけ、いい給料がもらえる。山のそばでいいところなんだ。どうして君は僕と結婚しちゃいけないの？どうしてなんだい？そこに僕と一緒に住んでもらいたい。一生のあいだ、あそこでだれか支えてくれる人にいてもらいたいんだ」</p>

<p>「あなたにもっと合ったほかの人が見つかるでしょう」と彼女が言った。</p>
<p>「もちろん別の女の子を簡単に見つけることができるかもしれない。それは分かってる。でも本当に結婚したいと思った人はひとりもいない。これまで一生一緒にいたいと思った人はいない。僕は自分の全人生のことを考えている。もし結婚するなら、生涯一緒にいられる人を思っている。ほかの女の子たちか ―― でもそうだね、ただの女の子にすぎない。時折一緒に散歩にでかけたりするのにいいだけ。ちょっと遊ぶのにはいいけれど。でも自分の人生を考えると、そういう人と結婚したくない。そういうことだよ」</p>
<p>「その人たちがよい奥さんにならないという意味なの？」</p>
<p>「その通り。でも、彼女たちが妻としての義務を尽くしてくれないという意味じゃないよ。つまり ――自分でも何を言いたいのか分からない。でも自分の人生を考え、君のことを考えた時、そのふたつのことがひとつになるんだ」</p>
<p>「じゃ、ひとつにならなかったらどうなるの？」奇妙な嘲笑的な調子で彼女は言った。</p>
<p>「いや、うまく行くと思うよ」</p>
<p>ふたりはしばらく黙ったままだった。彼は彼女の手を握っていたが、それ以上の愛の行為はしなかった。彼女が女であり、傷つきやすく、近づきやすい存在であることが分かったので、彼の魂にある種の重みが加わった。愛の行為をすることをためらった。そのような行為をすることに恐れさえ感じた。彼女は女であり、傷つきやすく、やっと自分が近づけるようになったのだ。だから恐れに似た気持ちを抱いていて、目の前にありながらも、そうした行動を取るのをためらった。それは最後に彼が入る一種の暗闇であるが、しかし今、彼はそれについて考えることすら望まなかった。彼女は妻になる女性である、そして彼は突然、彼女のなかに奇妙な傷つきやすさがあることに気付き、自分にはそれを守る責任があることに気付いた。</p>

<p>「こんなことをしているからよ」</p>

<p>「違うわ。自分のことよ。馬鹿なことしている。それも大馬鹿なこと」</p>
<p>「どうして。実は、僕と結婚したくないから？」</p>
<p>「本当のことを言うとね、したいのかしたくないのか分からない。まさにそう。分からないわ」</p>
<p>暗闇のなか、彼は当惑して彼女を見詰めた。彼女が何を思っているのか、まったく分からない。</p>
<p>「今ここで僕と座っていたいのかいたくないのか分からないの？」と彼は訊いた。</p>
<p>「ええ、分からないわ、まったくね。ほかの場所にいたいのか、ここにいたいのかも分からない。本当に分からないの」</p>
<p>「バンフォードさんと一緒にいたほうがよかった？ 一緒に寝室にいたほうがよかったの？」と彼はあえて挑戦的に訊いた。</p>
<p>長い間考えてから彼女は答えた。</p>
<p>「そうしたくない」ついに彼女は言った。「そう望んではいない」</p>
<p>「彼女と一生暮らしたいの？ ―― 君の髪の毛が白くなって、年取るまで？」と彼は訊いた。</p>
<p>「そうはしたくない」たいして躊躇することもなく彼女は答えた。「ジルとわたしがおばあさんになるまで一緒にいるとは思えない」</p>
<p>「僕がおじいさんになって、君がおばあさんになっても、今と同じように一緒にいるかもしれない、と思わない？」と彼は訊いた。</p>
<p>「まあ、そうね、今のようではないとしても」と彼女は答えた。「でも想像はできる ―― いいえ、できない。あなたが老人になったところなんて想像できない。それに、そう考えるのが恐ろしい」</p>
<p>「なんだって？年寄りになることが？」</p>
<p>「もちろんよ」</p>
<p>「その時が来れば、恐ろしくはなくなるよ」と彼は言った。「でも、今はその時じゃない。ただそうなるということだけだ。そうなる時、君に同じように、そばにいてもらいたい」</p>
<p>「養老年金というところね」と彼女は辛らつに言った。</p>
<p>彼女の不謹慎なユーモアにはいつも驚かされる。彼には、彼女がなに何を意図して言っているのか分からなかった。おそらく、彼女自身も分からないのだろう。</p>

<p>「あなたが年取った時のことを繰り返し言う意味が分からない」と彼女は言った。「わたし、九十じゃないのよ」</p>
<p>「だれもそんなこと言っていないよ」と怒って彼は言った。</p>
<p>ふたりとも別のことを考えながらしばらく黙り込んでいた。</p>
<p>「僕のことをからかうのはよしてほしい」と彼は言った。</p>

<p>「だめだ。今、僕は真剣なんだ。真剣な時は、それをからかうことはよしてほしい」</p>

<p>「ええ、信じるわ」と彼女は答えた。いつもの、飽き飽きしたような、無関心な、鼻にかかった声で答えた。疲れたからどうでもいいという感じだった。でも彼はかまわなかった。彼の心臓は熱く、高鳴っていた。<br /></p>
<p>「じゃ、僕が行く前に結婚としてくれるね？―― クリスマスくらいに？」<br /></p>
<p>「いいわ、そうするわ」<br /></p>
<p>「やった！」と彼は叫んだ。「これで決まりだ」彼は黙って座っていた。意識が消えた。彼のなかの血管は大枝といわず小枝と言わず全部に火がついたように燃えていた。無意識に彼はただ彼女の両手を自分の胸に押し当てていた。異常な情熱が消えかけると、現実界に目覚めたようであった。<br /></p>
<p>「家に入ろうか？」と彼は言った。寒いということに気が付いたというようだった。</p>
<p>彼女は返事せずに立ち上がった。</p>
<p>「行く前にキスして。承知したのだから」と彼は言った。</p>

<p>バンフォードは若者の赤味を帯びた興奮した顔を見た。彼は奇妙に背が高く、輝き、気味悪く見える。マーチの顔は優しい表情をしていた。彼女は顔を隠し、覆い、見えないようにしたいと思っていた。</p>

<p>眼を輝かせながら、彼は彼女が感じたことを何かしら見て取った。彼女がバンフォードと一緒にいなければならないことを考えると彼は当惑し、苦しかった。</p>
<p>「君が約束してくれたことは決して忘れないよ」と彼は言った。彼女の眼をまっすぐに覗き込んで見詰めた。彼はその奇妙に輝く眼で、彼女の心まで支配するようであった。</p>

<p>そして彼女は西へ去る列車を見送った。<a href="#calibre_link-175">彼の宿営地はソールズベリ平野にあった。</a>大きな黒い眼を見開きながら、彼女は彼を見送った。列車が彼の奇妙な丸ぽちゃの、赤ら顔を乗せて遠ざかるとともに、人生での真実がすべて遠ざかっていくようだった。その顔は、頬のあたりが横に広く、むっとした怒りが額に現われたり、あるいは眼を輝かして一点を見据えている時のほかは、決して表情が変わることがないように見えた。列車が離れて行く今、突然その表情になった。彼は客車の窓から身を乗り出し、さようならを言いながら彼女を見詰めていたが、顔の表情はまったく変わらなかった。彼の顔にはまったく感情が現われなかった。眼だけが緊張して、ネコが突然、何か見つけてじっと見詰めるかのように、焦点を絞って彼女を見た。列車に乗った若者が、じっと見詰めたまま離れていくと、彼女は激しい孤独感とともに残された。彼の身体が目の前にないと、彼の何ものも持っていないように思えた。すべてを失った気がした。彼の顔だけが心に残った。丸ぽちゃの赤味を帯びた無表情な頰、筋の通った鼻、その上からじっと見詰めるふたつの眼。覚えているのは、仔犬が戯れに唸る時にするように、彼が笑う時は鼻に皺が寄る、ということだけだった。しかし、彼、彼自身、彼がどんな人間かということになると ―― 彼女は何も知らなかった、彼が去ったあとには何も残らなかった。</p>

<p>農園を去ってから9日目に、彼は次のような手紙をもらった。</p>
<p>ヘンリー様</p>
<p>わたしとあなたのことを、すべて、もう一度よく考えてみました。そして、それはわたしには不可能なことのように思われます。あなたがいない今、自分が馬鹿だったことが分かります。あなたがここにいると、物事の現実が見えなくなるようです。あなたがいると物事は夢のように見えるので、わたしは何が何やら分からなくなります。こうしてふたたびジルといると、正気を取り戻すようです。なんて馬鹿なまねをしていたことか、あなたに対して何と不誠実であったか、と気付くのです。なぜなら、わたしがあなたを本当に愛していると心の中で感じられないのに、この関係を続けることはあなたに対して誠実とは言えません。人は愛についてたわごとをたくさん言います。でも、わたしはそれをしたくないのです。飾りのない事実に即して、分別ある行動をしたいと思います。今のわたしはそうしていないと思います。どんな理由であなたと結婚するか分からないのです。若い馬鹿な娘であったころなら男たちと一緒に遊びあるいていましたが、今のわたしはそんな風に我を忘れることはありません。わたしにとってあなたは赤の他人です、これからもそうでしょう。そうすると、わたしはどんな理由であなたと結婚するのでしょうか。ジルに関していえば、彼女は十倍もわたしにとって現実的です。わたしは彼女を知っているし、とても好きです。なのに、自分が彼女の小指でも傷つけるとしたらわたしは人でなしです。わたしたちは一緒に生活しています。永遠に一緒にいるというわけにはいきませんが、それが続く以上はひとつの人生です。そしてわたしたちふたりが生きている間は続くでしょう。何歳まで生きるかはだれにも分かりません。彼女は可哀そうに体が弱いのです。おそらくわたし以外、だれも彼女がどんなに弱いか知らないでしょう。わたしについていえば、いつか井戸に落ちるかも知れません。わたしにとってまったく分かりそうもないのは、あなたです。あなたと一緒の時にわたしが何を考え、どう振舞ったかについて考えると、それはわたしの気が少し変だからだったと思います。若いうちから頭が弱くなっているとは考えたくないですが、そんな感じです。あなたは赤の他人です。わたしのこれまで知っている人とは違います。わたしたちには共通点もないように思います。愛についていえば、その言葉そのものがありえません。ジルの場合でさえ、愛が何を意味するか分かります。しかし、あなたとの関係において、愛はまったくありえません。それからカナダに行く話。その約束をした時のわたしは頭がどうかしていたのでしょう。承知したことを思い出すと、自分でもぎょっとしているほどです。責任を取れないのにまったく馬鹿なことをして ―― 果ては精神病院で生涯を終えるのでないかと思います。わたしがこれまでしてきたことからすれば、それが一番わたしにふさわしいとあなたはお考えでしょう。でもわたしにとっては愉快なことではありません。ありがたいことに、ここにはジルがいます。彼女のそばにいると正気に戻れるのです。そうでないと自分が何をしでかすか分からないのです。ある晩、銃の事故を起こすとか、何かしでかすかも知れません。ジルを愛しています。そしてジルがいることで安心し正気になれます。このような馬鹿なことをしたことに対して彼女は怒りながらも愛してくれるのです。ええ、わたしが言いたいことは、全部のことから手を引いてください、と言うことです。あなたと結婚できません。自分にとって間違いと思えるようなことはしたくありません。何もかもすべて大きな間違いです。わたしはとんでもない馬鹿なことをしました。わたしにできるのは、あなたにお詫びをして、どうか忘れてほしいということだけです。お願いだから、これ以上わたしのことを考えないでください。あなたのキツネの毛皮は大体できあがりました。問題はないようです。今でも、この住所で間違っていないかどうか、さらに、わたしのあなたに対するひどい狂気じみた行為をお許しくださり、それで終わりにしてくださるかどうか、連絡をいただければ折り返し郵送させていただきます。</p>
<p>ジルからよろしく、とのことです。クリスマスのあいだ、彼女の両親がわたしたちと一緒に過ごす予定です。</p>

<p>若者は宿営地で装具を掃除しながらこの手紙を読んだ。歯噛みした。そして一瞬間、青ざめ、怒りで眼の周りの色が変わった。何も言わなかったし、何も見えなかった。体中、怒りで一杯になり、思慮分別を忘れた。邪魔された！また、邪魔された！邪魔された！彼はあの女がほしかった。彼女を手に入れることが運命であるかのように執着した。この女と結婚することは彼の宿命であり、運命であり、報酬であると感じた。彼女は自分にとってこの世における天国であり地獄だ。あの世ではそんなものは一切要らない。こみ上げてくる怒りと邪魔されたことで狂気のようになった彼は、何も眼に入らないままその朝を過ごした。ひそかにひとつの決着に向かう計略を考えなかったら、彼は気違いじみた行為をしたであろう。心の奥底で、叫び、吠え、歯噛みし、物を壊したい気持ちになった。しかし、そんなことをするほど馬鹿ではない。世間の方がうわ手だということは分かっていた。だから計略を立てねばならない。歯噛みしながら、何やら悪意のある生き物のように鼻を奇妙に心持ち上げて、視線を固め、凝視し、怒りと抑圧で酔ったような状態のまま午前中の仕事をした。心の中には、ひとつのことしかなかった ―― バンフォード。彼はマーチが書いてきた感情のほとばしりは意に介さなかった。彼の心にささった1本の棘がうずいた。それはバンフォードだった。彼の心、魂、全身のなかで狂気にさせるようにうずく棘。彼はバンフォードという棘を抜いてしまいたかった。バンフォードという棘を彼の全生涯から抜いてしまいたかった、たとえ自分の命を落とすとしても。</p>

<p>彼はこの計略を心に抱いたまま、24時間の休暇を願い出た。規則に従えば、自分には与えられないと分かっていた。彼の意識はこの世の人間とは思えないほど鋭くなっていた。どこに行ったらよいか分かっている ―― 大尉のところだ。だが、どうやって大尉の元へ行けるだろうか。この木造の仮兵舎とテントの大きな宿営地では、大尉がどこにいるか見当がつかなかった。</p>
<p>だが、彼は士官用の酒保に行った。彼の隊の大尉が他の3人の士官と立ち話をしている。ヘンリーは入口で直立不動の姿勢をとった。</p>
<p>「ベリマン大尉殿にお目にかかりたいです」大尉は彼と同じくコーンウォールの出身だった。</p>
<p>「何か用かね？」と大尉は言った。</p>
<p>「大尉殿、お話ししたいことがあるのです」</p>
<p>「用件は？」仲間の士官たちから離れずに言った。</p>
<p>ヘンリーは黙ったまま、しばらく上官を見詰めていた。</p>
<p>「承知していただけるでしょうか？」と彼はまじめな調子で言った。</p>
<p>「事柄によるな」</p>
<p>「24時間の休暇をいただけませんか」</p>
<p>「駄目だ、お前はそれを申し出る権利がない」</p>
<p>「権利がないのは分かっています。しかし、どうしてもお願いしなければならないのです」</p>
<p>「わしの返事はもうしている」</p>
<p>「大尉殿、断らないでください」</p>

<p>入口に、いつまでも立っている若者の態度には妙なものがあった。コーンウォール出身の大尉はすぐにそのおかしなところに気付き、鋭い眼で見た。</p>
<p>「どうしたんだ。何か起こったのか？」と彼は好奇心に動かされて訊いた。</p>
<p>「ちょっと困ったことができたのです。ブルーベリに行かねばならないのです」</p>
<p>「ブルーベリだって？女か？」</p>
<p>「はい、女のことです。大尉殿」若者は頭を少し前に突き出して立っていたが、突然、青ざめて血の気を失い、唇は苦痛の色が見えた。大尉はそれに気付くと、自分も少し青ざめ、横を向いた。</p>
<p>「それなら、行け」と彼は言った。「しかしトラブルは起こすなよ、どんなことでも」</p>
<p>「起こしません。大尉殿、ありがとうございます」</p>
<p>若者は去った。<a href="#calibre_link-279">大尉は、気持ちを静めるためにジン・アンド・ビターズを飲んだ。</a>ヘンリーは何とか自転車を借りた。宿営地を出たのは12時だった。60マイルの道中、雨で濡れたぬかる脇道を行かねばならなかった。彼は食べることも忘れて自転車をこいだ。</p>

<p>農園では、しばらく前から取りかかっていた仕事でマーチは忙しかった。<a href="#calibre_link-322">ハリエニシダの茂みが広がるふたつの牧草地を分ける柵が、小さな土手の上で走っているが、その土手で、吹き抜け小屋の隅っこにあたる所に、数本のアカマツが立っていた。</a>この中の一番端の木は枯れていた。夏のうちに枯れたのだ。針状の葉が枯れて茶色に変色している。たいして高い木ではなかった。幹まで枯れていた。伐採は禁じられていたが、マーチはその木がほしかった。薪が乏しい時なので燃料として、これ以上のものはないと思った。</p>
<p>かれこれ1週間、時折、幹をこっそり切っていた。だれにも気付かれないように5分間ほどずつ、根元に近い所に斧を入れていた。鋸は使っていなかった。ひとりでは、とても骨が折れるからである。今では木の根元付近には切り口が大きく開いていた。1本の腱の上に立っているだけで、倒れんばかりであった。しかし踏みこたえていた。</p>

<p>雨模様の12月の午後遅くのことだった。冷たい霧が森からも、窪地からも這い上がってくる。闇は空から下りてくるばかりであった。太陽がかなた向こうの低い木立に消えようとしているあたりは、薄い黄色に染まっていた。マーチは斧を持ってその木のところに行った。そのカンカンという小さな響きは屋敷のあたりに頼りなく響いた。バンフォードは厚手のコートを着て外に出て来た。帽子はかぶっていなかったので、おかっぱにした細い髪は松の木や木立をざわざわと鳴らす風にかき乱されていた。</p>
<p>「心配なのは」とバンフォードが言った。「小屋の上に倒れることね。そうすると、また、それを直さなければならないから」</p>
<p>「そうならないと思う」とマーチは言った。体を伸ばして腕で額の汗をぬぐった。顔は上気していた。瞳は大きく奇妙に見開き、上唇がめくれて2本の白い歯がむき出しに見え、せんさく好きのウサギのような顔つきをしていた。</p>
<p>黒いオーバーに身を包み山高帽を被った、小柄でずんぐりした男が中庭をぶらぶらやって来た。赤ら顔に白い口髭をはやして、やや小さめな薄青の眼をしている。それほど年寄りではなかったが神経質そうで、小刻みに歩いて来た。</p>
<p>「お父さん、どう思う？」とバンフォードは言った。「小屋の上に倒れそうかしら？」</p>
<p>「小屋だと、いいや！」とその老人は言った。「小屋にあたるはずはない。柵にあたるかもしれないが」</p>
<p>「柵はかまわないわ」とマーチが甲高い声で言った。</p>
<p>「間違っているのはいつもわたしね」バンフォードは、眼にかかるほつれた髪の毛を払いのけながら言った。</p>

<p>その木はいわば自分自身のわずかな支えの上に立ち、傾き、風にきしんでいる。ふたつの牧草地の間にある、細くて水の枯れた溝の脇の土手に生えていた。<a href="#calibre_link-303">土手の一番高いところには柵があり、丘の上の藪に向ってだらだらと続いている。牧草地の隅には、小屋にも近く、中庭に通じる門にも近い所に数本かの木が群がっていた。この門に向かって、単調な景色の牧草地を横切るように、草の生えた平坦な小道があった。その先は主要道路につながっていた。</a>この小道に沿ってもうひとつ、よろよろした柵が立っていた。短くて、太く、離れて立つ杭を、長い、割れ目のある横棒が結びつけていた。3人は小屋のある方の牧草地の隅っこで、ちょうど中庭に通じる門の上手にある、その木の後ろに立っていた。ふたつの切妻とポーチがある母屋が、中庭の向こうの芝生を張った前庭にきれいな姿で立っていた。赤いウールのショールを肩にかけた小柄で太った女性が家から出てきて、ポーチに立った。</p>
<p>「倒れないの？」と甲高い、小さな声で叫んだ。</p>
<p>「おれもそのことだけを考えているんだよ」と、その夫が叫び返した。ふたりの娘たちに対する彼の口調は嘲笑的で皮肉であった。彼がそこにいるかぎり、マーチは木を切る仕事を続けたくなかった。その男についていえば、自分の娘のように、肩のリューマチについてぶつくさ言って、必要がなければ棒切れ1本も拾い上げさえしないだろう。そんな風にして3人は寒い午後、中庭の近くの隅に、しばらく黙って立っていた。</p>

<p>彼らは、遠くで門をとんとん叩く音を聞いた。そして首を伸ばして見た。ずっと向こうの草が生えている平らな小道を、ひとつの人影が一旦下りた自転車に、また乗ってふらふらと近づいて来た。</p>
<p>「うちの息子のだれかだな―― ジャックだ」と老人は言った。</p>
<p>「そんなはずはないわよ」とバンフォードは言った。</p>
<p>マーチは首を伸ばして見た。彼女だけは、そのカーキ色の主が分かった。彼女は顔を赤らめたが、黙っていた。</p>
<p>「違うな、ジャックではない。そうじゃない」白いまつ毛の下の小さな丸い青い眼でじっと見ながら、老人は言った。</p>
<p>次の瞬間、よろめく自転車が視界に入ってきて、乗り手が門で下りた。ヘンリーだ。その顔には汗が流れ、泥がはねている。全身泥だらけの姿であった。</p>
<p>「おや！」と不安そうにバンフォードは叫んだ。「驚いたわ、ヘンリーじゃないの！」</p>
<p>「何だって？」と老人はつぶやいた。彼はだみ声で、早口でつぶやくような口調で、少し耳が遠かった。</p>
<p>「何だって、何だって？誰だって、あの若者は？ ネリーの彼氏か？これは、これは！」皮肉な笑みが、白いまつ毛の赤ら顔に現われた。</p>

<p>ヘンリーは汗びっしょりの額から濡れた髪の毛をかき上げながら、彼らの姿を確認し、老人が言ったことを聞いた。彼の熱くて若者らしい顔は、冷たい光のなかで燃え上がるようだった。</p>
<p>「お揃いですね！」彼は、突然、仔犬のように小さく笑った。自転車に乗りつづけて火照って、ぼうっとして、自分がどこにいるのか分からない感じだった。彼は自転車を柵に立てかけると、中庭に行かないで土手の片隅に登って来た。</p>
<p>「まさか、あなたが来るとは思わなかったわよ」とバンフォードがそっけなく言った。</p>
<p>「ええ、僕もそう思ってました」と彼はマーチを見ながら言った。</p>
<p>彼女は、離れて片膝をゆるめ、ゆったりとした姿勢で立ち、斧の頭をちょっと地面につけていた。彼女の瞳は大きく見開き、ぼんやりしていて、上唇からは歯が見え、頼りない、魂を奪われたウサギの顔つきになっていた。彼の燃える赤い顔を見た瞬間、彼女には、なすすべがなかった。縛られてしまったかのように、どうすることも出来なかった。彼が、例の仕方で頭を前に突き出すのに気が付いたその瞬間、縛られてしまったのだ。</p>

<p>「だれなんだね、一体。とにかく何という名前なんだね？」微笑を浮かべた皮肉な顔つきの老人はつぶやくように訊いた。</p>
<p>「忘れたの？グレンフェルさんですよ。話したでしょう、お父さん」とバンフォードは冷たく言った。</p>
<p>「お前が話してくれたと思う。ほかのことは、ほとんど話してくれなかったからな」老人は顔に奇妙な、からかう表情をちょっと浮かべてつぶやいた。「はじめまして」と言って、ヘンリーの方に手を伸ばした。</p>
<p>若者は驚きながら握手した。それからふたりは離れた。</p>
<p>「ソールズベリ平野から自転車で来たのかね」と老人は尋ねた。</p>
<p>「そうです」</p>
<p>「そうかね！かなりの距離だ。どのくらいかかったかね。かなりでしょう？数時間かね」</p>
<p>「約4時間です」</p>
<p>「えっ、4時間も！いやはや、その位かかると思ったよ。いつお帰りですかね？」</p>
<p>「明日の夕方までに帰らなければなりません」</p>
<p>「明日の夕方までに。なるほど、そうかね！彼女たちは君が来るとは思わなかったろうな」</p>
<p>老人は白いまつ毛の下の薄青で小さな丸い眼を嘲笑するように娘たちの方に向けた。ヘンリーも、周囲をぐるりと見た。少し居心地が悪くなった。マーチを見ると、彼女はどこに牛がいるのか探しているかのように遠くを見詰めている。その手は斧の取っ手をつかんでいた。斧の先は地面にちょこっとついている。</p>

<p>「そこで何をしていたんですか？」彼は、優しくて丁重な口調で訊いた。「木を切り倒していたの？」</p>
<p>マーチは、ぼうっとしていて、聞こえないようだった。</p>
<p>「そうなのよ」とバンフォードが言った。「1週間以上かかっているのよ」</p>
<p>「それは！じゃあ、あなたたちだけでしたんですか」</p>
<p>「ネリーがしたのよ。わたしは何もしなかった」とバンフォードは言った。</p>
<p>「そうなんですか。とても大変だったでしょう」と彼は奇妙に優しい調子でマーチに向かって言った。彼女は答えなかった。彼女は半ば顔を背けて忘我状態にいるように、向こうの森の方を見ている。</p>
<p>「ネリーったら、聞いているの！」とバンフォードは鋭い声で叫んだ。「返事をしなさいよ」</p>
<p>「何 ―― わたしのこと？」とぎくりとして振り向いて、みんなをそれぞれ見ながら言った。「だれかわたしに話しかけた？」</p>
<p>「これは、これは。夢をみておるな！」と老人は脇を向いて微笑んだ。「昼間から夢を見るなんて、恋をしているんだよ」</p>
<p>「わたしに何か言ったの？」とマーチは異域から見るよう若者を見詰めた。彼女の瞳は大きく開き、話しかけた人はいないと思っているらしく、顔はかすかに赤らんでいた。</p>
<p>「木を切り倒すのに大変だったでしょう、と言ったんです」と彼は丁寧に答えた。</p>
<p>「ああ、そのこと！少しずつ切ったの。終わってもいい頃だと思っていたのよ」</p>
<p>「夜中に倒れて押しつぶされるんじゃないかとひやひやしていたけれど、幸い無事でしたわ」とバンフォードが言った。</p>
<p>「じゃあ、君に代わって僕に決着つけさせてください」と若者は言った。</p>
<p>マーチは彼の方に斧の柄を傾けた。</p>
<p>「そうしてくれます？」と彼女は言った。</p>
<p>「よろしければ」と彼は言った。</p>
<p>「倒れれば、感謝しますわ。これが片付けば助かる、ということだけよ」と彼女はどうでもいいというように答えた。</p>

<p>「どちらに倒れるかしら？」とバンフォードが言った。「小屋に当たりそう？」</p>
<p>「いや、小屋には当たりません」と彼は言った。「あの辺に倒れる。何にも当たらないで。でも、ねじれて柵に当たるかもしれない」</p>
<p>「柵に当たるって！」と老人は叫んだ。「何だって、柵に当たるって！あの角度に傾いていているのに？柵は小屋よりもずっと先だ。柵には当たるまい」</p>
<p>「おっしゃるとおりです」とヘンリーは言った。「当たらないと思います。周りは空き地ですから、何にも当たりません」</p>
<p>「逆方向にいる、我々の頭の上に倒れてはこないかね？」老人は皮肉な調子で言った。</p>
<p>「そうはなりません」ヘンリーは短い丈のオーバーと軍服の上着を脱ぎながら言った。「アヒルども、アヒルども、さあ戻って！」</p>
<p><a href="#calibre_link-293">4羽の茶色の斑点のある雌アヒルが茶と緑の雄アヒルに先導されて一列になって、丘の上の牧草地から風に逆らって下りて来た。荒れる海の上を漕ぐボートのようであった。全速力で体をゆらしながら柵に向かって、小さくかたまっている人間たちの方へやって来た。スペインの無敵艦隊の来襲を知らせるように興奮して鳴いていた。</a><br /></p>

<p>「おバカちゃんたち！おバカちゃんたち！」バンフォードは叫び、進み出てさえぎろうとした。しかし、ひたすらに、アヒルは彼女の方に向かってやって来た。黄色と緑の口を開けて興奮して何かを話したそうにガーガー鳴いている。</p>
<p>「食べるものは何もないわ。ここには何もないわよ。ちょっと待ってね」とバンフォードはアヒルたちに向かって言った。「あっちに行って。あっちに行って。中庭の方に行ってちょうだい」</p>
<p>アヒルたちは去らないので、バンフォードは柵に登り、門扉の下でアヒルの方向を曲げて中庭に行くようにした。それでアヒルの列はまた興奮してガアガア鳴きながらゴンドラの舟尾のように尻を振り、門の横棒の下をくぐって行った。バンフォードは、柵のすぐ上の、一番高い所に立って、3人を見下ろしていた。</p>
<p>ヘンリーは見上げると、彼女の眼鏡の後ろから見詰めている、丸い瞳孔の弱々しい視線とぶつかった。彼の心は乱れなかった。彼は傾いた倒れそうな、ふらふらした木を見た。そして、飛ぶ鳥を見詰める猟師のように空を見上げながら、思った。「もし木があっちに倒れ、倒れる時にねじれるならば、土手の一番高いところに立つ彼女に、あそこにある枝が当たるだろう」</p>

<p>彼は、また彼女を見た。彼女は、癖になっている身振りで、額から髪の毛をかき上げていた。彼は心の中で彼女は死ぬものと決めた。恐ろしい静かな力が彼のなかに沸き上がった。ほかならぬ彼自身が発揮する力だ。彼が髪の毛一本でも間違った方向に向くならば、彼はその力を失うだろう。</p>
<p>「バンフォードさん、気を付けて」と彼は言った。彼の心臓は完全に静かであった。彼女を動かしてはならない、という恐ろしくも純粋な意志の力が働いた。</p>
<p>「だれのこと言ってるの、わたしが気を付けなければならないって？」と彼女は叫んだ。その声には父親そっくりの嘲笑する口調が表れていた。「まさか、わたしを斧で叩くつもりじゃないでしょうね？」</p>
<p>「違うよ。でも木が当たるかもしれないよ」と彼はまじめな調子で答えた。しかし、彼女には、その言葉は彼が自分を動かしたいので、わざと心配したふりをしてそう言っているように聞こえた。</p>
<p>「そんなことは絶対ないわよ」と彼女は言った。</p>
<p>彼はその声を聞いた。彼は力を失わないよう、氷のようにぴくりとも動かなかった。「そうじゃない、ありえますよ。こちらに下りて来たほうがいいですよ」</p>
<p>「いいわよ。カナダ式の伐採の名人芸を見せてちょうだい」と彼女は答えた。</p>
<p>「よし、分かった」と彼は斧をとって自分に危険がないことを確かめるために見回した。</p>

<p>純粋な、動きのとまった、何が起こるか分からない瞬間が来た。世界中のことがすべて静止したようだった。それから突然、彼の姿がきらめき、異常に高くなり、恐ろしいものになった。彼は間をおかず続けて2回、すばやく、きらめく斧を打ちこんだ。木は真っ二つになり、空中でゆっくり回転し、奇妙にねじれ、突然の暗闇が下りるように地面に倒れた。彼以外は何が起こっているのか分からなかった。大枝の暗い端が舞い下りて来てバンフォードに当たった時、彼女のあげた小さな叫び声をだれも聞かなかった。彼女が少ししゃがんだ時、首の後ろに一撃を受けたのをだれも見なかった。彼女が向こうに投げ出されて柵の下にピクピク動く小さなかたまりとなっているのをだれも見なかった。若者だけが見ていた。異様に輝く眼で、撃ち落とした野鴨を見るように見詰めていた。羽根が傷ついただけか、死んだのか？死んだな！</p>
<p>すぐに彼は大きな声で叫んだ。続いてマーチが、気が狂ったような悲鳴を上げた。悲鳴は午後の空気を伝ってどこまでも響いていった。父親は異様な、吠えるような声を上げた。</p>

<p>若者は柵を跳び越え、その倒れた姿に向かって走った。首と頭の後ろは、顔を背けたくなるほど血だらけだった。彼は遺体をひっくり返した。小刻みに痙攣していたが、間違いなく死んでいる。それが分かった。彼の眼だけではなく、彼の魂と血がそれを知っていた。彼の内的生の必然性は実現しようとしているのだ。生きなければならないのは彼なのだ。臓腑の中に突き刺さった棘は抜かれた。彼は彼女の体をそっと地面に下ろした。彼女は死んだのだ。</p>
<p>彼は立ち上がった。マーチは石になったように動かず、立ちつくした。彼女の顔は死人のように血の気がなかった。その大きな眼は黒いよどみのようだった。老人はひどい格好で柵を登っている。</p>
<p>「残念ながら、この枝が彼女を殺したようです」と若者は言った。</p>
<p>老人は不器用に柵を越えながら奇妙な声で泣き出していた。「一体どうなったの！」マーチは電気に触れたように身震いしながら叫んだ。</p>
<p>「残念ながらね」と青年は繰り返した。</p>
<p>マーチがやって来た。彼女が柵のところに来る前に、彼はそれを越えていた。</p>
<p>「どうなの？殺したって？」なじるような声で言った。</p>
<p>「残念ながら」と彼は静かに答えた。</p>
<p>彼女はさらに血の気を失い、おびえた。ふたりは面と向かって立った。最後の抵抗の姿勢を示しながら彼女は黒い瞳で彼をにらみつけた。その必死の抵抗もむなしいのが分かると彼女は鼻をぐずぐずしはじめた。泣きたくないのだが、心が折れてしまった子どものように、大げさではないが震えながら、しくしく泣きはじめた。まだ本当に泣いているわけではなくて、涙は出ず、ただ恐れて、しゃくりあげていた。</p>

<p>彼は勝った。マーチは、そこにどうしようもなく立ち、涙を流さず、身体をふるわせて泣いた。口元は激しく震えていた。それから、突然子どものように、どっと涙がほとばしりでた。何も分からず、ただ悲しくて泣くのであった。草の上に泣き崩れた。胸に両手を当てて、顔を上げ、何も見えず体を震わせて泣いた。若者は黙って、青ざめて、いつまでも、そのままでいるかのように彼女のそばに立っていた。身動きせず彼女を見下ろしていた。この場の光景に責め苦しめられ、彼自身の心臓も臓腑までも責め苦しめられながらも彼はうれしかった。自分は勝ったのだ。</p>
<p>長い間そうしていたあと、彼女のそばにしゃがみこみ、その両手を取った。</p>
<p>「泣くのをやめて」と優しく言った。「泣かないで」</p>
<p>マーチは涙をあふれさせながら彼を見上げた。無力感と屈伏からくる呆然とした表情であった。まるで見えない眼で見るように彼を見上げつづけた。もう彼女は自分のもとを去ることはないだろう。自分は彼女を手に入れたのだ。彼はそれを知り、うれしかった。彼は命をかけてでも彼女を手に入れたかったからだ。彼の人生にはどうしても彼女が必要なのだ。そして今、彼女を手に入れたのだった。彼の人生になければならないものだった。</p>

<p>彼女を手に入れたが、本当に手に入れたわけではなかった。ふたりは彼が計画していたようにクリスマスに結婚して、彼はふたたび10日間の休暇を得た。コーンウォールの海のそばにある彼の故郷の村へ行った。彼女が農園で働くのはもはや無理であることを彼は悟っていた。</p>
<p>彼女は彼のものであり、まるで彼から離れられない、彼の影のように生きているのだが、幸福ではなかった。マーチは彼のもとを去りたくはなかったが、しかし彼と一緒にいると自由を感じることができなかった。彼の周囲のものが彼女を見張り、彼女にのしかかるかのようであった。彼は彼女を手に入れ、彼女を自分のそばにおいた。彼の妻なのだ。そして彼女から見れば ―― 自分が彼のものであることは分かっていた。しかし、彼女はそれでもうれしくはなかった。彼はまだ、満たされていなかった。彼は彼女と結婚したのだが、可能な限り、あらゆる点で彼女を所有していることは明らかだが、そして彼女も彼から所有されることを欲し、ほかのものは何も欲しなかったが、それでも、今、完全な合一はできていないと彼は思った。</p>

<p>何かが欠けている。彼女の魂は新しい生命で躍動する代わりに、あたかも傷ついたように、うなだれ、血を流しているのだ。彼女は長い間、自分の手を相手に握らせたまま、海を眺めているだけなのだ。彼女の黒い、うつろな瞳はどこか傷ついていた。彼女の顔は少しやつれていた。彼が話しかけると、彼女は微かな、これまでになかったような微笑みを浮かべた。古い愛の生活の中で死んでしまって、まだ新しい生活に入っていないような奇妙な震える笑みを浮かべるのだ。彼女は、ある方向に向かって精一杯努力すべきだということを感じてはいる。しかしやることは何もなかったし、どちらに向かったらよいかも分からないのであった。それなのに彼女は与えられた新しい愛に身をゆだねることが出来ないでいた。彼女は、自分が愛しているならば、なんらかの方法で愛するように努力すべきなのだと考えていた。愛する努力をする必要があるという現代風の考え方をいやいやながら受け入れてきた。しかし、実のところ、もはや愛の努力をする必要がないとも感じた。彼女が無理して愛することを、彼は望まない。そういう風にすると、彼は不機嫌になる。そうだ、彼女が自分に向かって無理に愛してほしくなかった。いや、彼女に受け身でいてほしかった。自分を受け入れて、愛の水面下に没していてほしかった。彼女は、ボートの上から見た流れ藻のようでなければならなかった。水の中で永遠に優美に揺れ、優美な根毛を優しく潮の流れにまかせ、影のような海の中で敏感に、まったく敏感に、そして受け身で揺れ、生きている間、決して、決して水の上に顔を出すこともない。決してない。死ぬまで水の上に顔を出すことはなく、死んだ時に初めて死体となって海面に浮かび、波に洗われるのだ。しかし生きている間は、いつも海の中に沈み、波の下にいるのだ。波の下でなら、鉄よりも強い根を持てるだろう。潮の中でなら、優しく揺れていながら、ねばり強く、危険な力を内に持つだろう。水の中でなら、陸上のたくましいオークの木よりも強く、不滅だろう。しかし、それはいつも海中でのことだ。いつも。彼女は女だから、そうなければならない。</p>

<p>それなのに、これまで彼女はその正反対の生活に慣れていた。彼女はこれまでずっと、愛と生活に全神経を向け、全責任を取らねばならなかった。来る日も来る日も、明日に対して、またやって来る年月に対して責任を取ってきた。いとおしいジルの健康について、幸福について、そして安全に対して。本当のところ、自分の力の範囲内でだが、彼女は世界の人たちの安寧に対して責任を感じてきた。自分の小さな片隅にいながら、世界の人たちの幸福に対して責任を負うという壮大な感情が彼女を励ましてきたのだ。</p>
<p>それなのに、彼女は失敗した。彼女は自分の小さな世界においてさえ、失敗したことを知っていた。自分自身の責任感を満足させることができなかった。それほど難しかったのだ。はじめは崇高で、また、たやすく見えた。しかし、努めれば努めるほど、難しくなった。愛する者を幸福にすることは簡単なように見える。しかし、努めれば努めるほど、失敗はひどくなる。恐ろしいことだ。これまでずっと手を伸ばしてとらえようとした。とらえようとするものが近くにあると思えて伸ばせる限度まで手を伸ばした。しかし、いつも、それは手が届かないところにあった。</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="calibre_link-404">
<div><div><div><div><div><p><a href="#calibre_link-405">13-D</a><br /></p>
<p>彼女にはいつも手が届かない、とらえどころがなく、実現ができないほど彼方にあった。最後には手元には何も残っていないのだ。得ようとして手を伸ばした人生、手を伸ばした幸福、取ろうと手を伸ばした安寧は、すべて、彼方にすべり落ちてしまい、実現せず、さらに手を伸ばすことになった。彼女は何らかのゴールがほしかった。ある終着点が ―― だが何も得られなかった。いつも、ほんの先にあるものを、ひどい格好でとらえようと手を伸ばした。同じようにジルを幸せにしようとしたが、同じことだった。ジルが死んでくれてうれしかった。彼女を決して幸福にすることは不可能であることが分かったからだ。ジルはいらいらして、だんだんやせて、ますます弱っていっただろう。苦痛は減るどころか、ひどくなったことだろう。いつまでもそうだろう。ジルが死んでくれてよかった。</p>
<p>そして、ジルがだれかと結婚したとしてもまったく同じことになったろう。男を幸福にしようと休みなく努め、自分の世界の幸福のために努めるであろう女になったろう。ただ、得るものはいつも失敗だけだ。金や野心やら、ちょっとした馬鹿な成功はあるかもしれない。しかし、一番成功を望む肝心なところで、すなわち、愛するものを幸福にする、申し分ないものにする、という、一番苦痛に満ちた努力をしながらそこで失敗すれば、それは破滅に近い。自分の愛するものを幸福にしたい。愛する男の幸福はつねに成就されるように見える。これを、あれを、他のことを、とやってみると、そうなるように見える。あれこれ誠実にやってみると、その度ごとに、失敗は少しずつひどくなる。自分をとことんまで愛し、休みなく自分を鞭打とうとすると物事はますます悪くなる。幸福は、そのようにして得られるものではない。幸福をはきちがえている。</p>

<p>かわいそうに、マーチは善意と責任感から、とうとう最後には人生の全体、すべてが無という深淵に落ち込んでしまうところまで自分に鞭打った。人は、届きそうな近くの裂け目に、青く、美しく震えている、幸福という死の花を取ろうと手を伸ばせば伸ばすほど、その断崖の恐ろしい深さに気が付くだろう。さらに手を伸ばせば、底なしの穴に落ちるように、必然的にそこに落ち込んでしまうのだ。花を次々に摘む ―― だが、それは目指す花ではない。花の本質、花のがくは恐ろしい深淵であり、底なしの穴なのだ。</p>
<p>求めるのが自分の幸福であろうと他人の幸福であろうと、幸福を探すということは突き詰めていえばそういうことなのだ。幸福を追究するならばいつも行きつくところは底なしの無に必然的に落ち込む。</p>

<p>ところで女性はどうか？ ―― 女性は幸福以外の目的がありうるのだろうか。自分と全世界の幸福。それだけであり、それ以外にはない。だから、責任感を持ち、目的に向かう。あの虹の端にそれが見える。あるいは、少し先に、青い彼方に見る。遠くではない、遠くではない。</p>
<p>だが、虹の端は決して到着することがない底なしの深淵である。青い彼方の空は努力を飲み込む底なしの空虚だ。努力を飲み込んで空虚にしてしまう。それでも空虚が減ることはない。人を、その努力を飲み込んでしまう。だから幸福を手にいれることができるなんて幻想だ！</p>

<div><div><div><div><div><p><a href="#calibre_link-289">13-G</a><br /></p>
<p>かわいそうなマーチ、彼女は青いゴールに向かって素晴らしいスタートを切った。行けば行くほど空虚を自覚してさらに恐ろしくなった。最後には、苦痛、そして狂気になる。</p>
<p>彼女はそれが終わってうれしかった。海岸に座り、西方の沖合をながめ、ひどい緊張が終わったことを知ってうれしかった。これからは愛とか幸福を決して求めないようにしよう。ジルは死んでよかった。可哀そうなジル、可哀そうなジル。きっと死とは甘いものに違いない。</p>
<p>マーチにとって、死は自分の運命ではない。自分の運命は若者に任せなければならない。しかし若者も問題だ。彼はそれ以上のことを求める。彼は逆らわずに自分に身を任せることを望んでいる。彼の中に深く沈み込むことを望んでいる。しかし、自分は ―― 自分は<a href="#calibre_link-388">最後の里程石</a>に座る女のように、静かに座り、見詰めていたい。自分は見たい、知りたい、理解したい。孤独でありたい。自分の横に彼がいても。</p>
<p>それなのに彼は違うのだ！自分がもはや見詰めることも、知ることも、理解することも望んでいなかった。<a href="#calibre_link-389">東洋の女性たちが顔を覆うように、彼はマーチが自分の精神をベールで覆うのを望んでいる。彼女がすべて彼に身を任せ、独立した精神まで眠らせてしまうのを望んでいる。彼女の努力、「存在理由」であるものまで取り去ろうとしている。</a>自分に服従させ、屈服させ、激しい意識をすべて捨てさせ、何も考えないようにさせたがっている。彼女の意識を奪い、ただ彼が所有する女にしようとしている。ただ彼の所有する女に。</p>

<p>彼女は疲れ果て、眠りたいが、まるで眠りが死であるかのように、眠気と戦っている子どものようであった。彼女は眠らないように努力して眼を大きく見開いているようだった。眠らずにいよう。知ろう。考え、判断し、決定しよう。自分が両手で持つ、自分の人生という手綱を離さないようにしよう。最後まで、独立したひとりの女でありたい。しかしすべてに疲れた。眠りは近くにあるように見える。若者の中にはそんな休息がある。</p>
<p>しかし、西コーンウォールの高く、荒々しい断崖のくぼみに座り、西方の海を眺めながら、彼女は眼をますます大きく見開いた。西方にはカナダがある、アメリカがある。知りたい。先にあるものを知りたい。若者は傍らに座り、カモメたちを眺め、額に皺をよせ、眼には不満の様子を浮かべた。彼が望むものは、彼女が眠り、自分の中で平穏になることだ。彼女が自分の中で平穏になり眠ることだ。それなのに、彼女が自分の中で眼を開けているのが、彼には死ぬほど苦しかった。どうしても彼女は眠ろうとしなかった ―― 決して。時折、彼は苦々しい気持ちになった。彼女と結婚しなければよかった、と。バンフォードを殺さなければよかった。バンフォードとマーチが互いに殺し合えばよかったんだ。</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="calibre_link-99">
<div><div><div><div><div><p><a href="#calibre_link-100">13-I</a><br /></p>
<p>しかし、それは性急な考えだ。それは自分にも分かる。彼は西に行く機会を、首を長くして待った。イギリスを離れ、西に行き、マーチを連れ去ることを、苦しみとしか言えない気持ちで待っていた。この岸を離れたい！大西洋を越えれば、ある意味では、自分のことを毒針で刺すようなこの憎むべきイギリスを去りさえすれば、マーチは眠ってくれるだろう。彼女はついに眼を閉じて、自分に屈服するだろう。</p>
<p>そうなれば、彼女を自分のものにすることができし、やっと自分自身の生活を送れるだろう。まだ自分自身の生活を送れていないと感じて苛立った。彼女が服従し自分の中で眠るならば、自分の人生を持てるだろう。そうなれば、ひとりの若い男として、男性として自分の人生を持てるだろう。彼女の方も、ひとりの女として、女性として彼女自身の生活を送れるだろう。このひどい緊張感もなくなるだろう。彼女も男性ではなくなる。つまり男性の責任を負った女性ではなくなる。いや、彼女自身に対する責任さえ、彼にゆだねなければならない。彼にはそうなることが分かっていて、彼女に頑固にあくまでも反抗し、そして彼女が降伏するのを待った。</p>

<p>「海を越えて、カナダに渡れば君も気持ちが晴れるよ」と断崖の上の岩の間で座っている時、彼は彼女に言った。</p>
<p>彼女は水平線を眺めた。それが幻であるかのように。それから彼の方を向いて、眠りたいのだが、眠らないように必死の努力をしている子どものような緊張した、奇妙な表情を見せた。</p>
<p>「そうなるかしら？」と彼女は言った。</p>
<p>「そうなるよ」と彼は静かに答えた。</p>
<p>すると眠気のために無意識にそうなるように、彼女の瞼はゆっくりと下がっていった。しかし、彼女はまた瞼を上げた。そして言った。</p>
<p>「そうね、そうなるかも知れないわね。分からないわ。あちらではどうなるか分からないわ」</p>
<p>「すぐに行くことができさえすればなあ！」と彼は言ったが、その声には苦痛が表れていた。</p>

<div><i><i><b><b><i>The Four Trials of Lady Chatterley's Lover and Other Essays on D.H. Lawrence</i></b></b></i></i></div>
<div>(English version)</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Finally, in 1957, Hitoshi Itō was found guilty by the Supreme Court of Japan for translating D.H.Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover. On the other hand, the publishers of the original book were found not guilty in the United States, England and Canada.</div>
<div>What caused the difference? This book is a comparative study of the issue.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>1957年、最高裁の上告棄却で伊藤整訳『チャタレイ夫人の恋人』が最終的に有罪になったが、その後アメリカ、イギリス、カナダの裁判では無罪判決であった。日本との違いは何であったのか ― 英国作家D.H.ロレンス研究の第一人者が丁寧に解説。</div>

<div><i><i><b><b><i>The Flies and Other Poems: English Poems by a Japanese</i></b></b></i></i></div>
<div>(English version)</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The writer is a Japanese. He has been reading and writing English poems since he studied English literature at university. He mainly likes lyrical poems, though he has been influenced by T.S.Eliot and other modernist poets.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>英国劇作家・詩人であるJames Kirkup氏にも絶賛された表題のThe Fliesをはじめ、著者の独特な視点から歌い上げた英詩集。</div>
<div>（英語版）<br /></div>

<div><b><b>法制史から見た昭和の小説</b></b></div>
<div><b><b><br /><b></b></b></b></div>
<div>英国作家D.H.ロレンス研究の第一人者が、法制史の視点から日本の小説を紹介。</div>
<div>1945年の敗戦で昭和という年号の時代は明治憲法の時代と現憲法の時代の2つに分かれる。明治憲法になじみのない現在の読者にとって、敗戦以前の小説を十分に理解することは難しい。本書は明治憲法に触れながら昭和の小説を読み、現在の読者には軽視されがちな点を指摘するものである。</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><img alt="kuramochi_4" src="images/00066.jpeg" /><br /></div>
<div><b><b>アジサイ　の　かげ　に【かながき　し】</b></b></div>
<div><b><b><br /><b></b></b></b></div>
<div>全篇「かな」で書かれたユニークな詩集がデジタル書籍で初登場。</div>
<div>特徴の1つは横書きであること。、詩集は縦書きだという固定観念に対し、本書はそれをこわすことを狙う。また、まったく漢字を使わないで、ひらがなと、カタカナだけで書いている点にも注目したい。漢字を使わないでも日本人の心情は表現できる、という著者の挑戦でもある。</div>
