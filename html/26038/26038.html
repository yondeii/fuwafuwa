<p id="calibre_link-19">Collaboration function How to use</p>
<p id="calibre_link-20">Protools12.5 collaboration features have been added to. By using this function you can sessions music you and others made. First, log in to the Avid Master Account. It is to sign in from the file menu. Then you can invite others and start sharing artist chat from the window menu. First download the track of others (1) their track Let's first upload Once you have completed. (2) notification chat and trucks When you receive from the other party comes in (3). (4) is a measure of cloud storage usage of the current project. In plus tax per month 1,200 yen, you can earn the storage of 5 project / 20GB (40 times the cloud storage capacity of the free plan). When dealing with large-scale sessions and projects, it can be enlarged by excluding tax per month 3,100 yen to storage and up to 10 projects of 60GB. It is to upload the arrow, such as wearing BPM and their songs (5). It is to download a track of upload and others their own track (6). It is to share (7). And (8) displays the name of the people of the track made. It is easy to upload your own track, just download and share people's track so it's easy. There is a chat function to work in real time. In advance to a meeting with Skype and Facetime, it is only a simple update of sharing the track with each other. Let's share songs made by myself and others and make songs. Orange No. 8 turns amber in the other party work, it will be blue while he is working. If there is no name, there will be no one. When No. 6 is of dark green it will be displayed when the opponent has started the upload. Upon completion of your track, upload it and have the other party download it. Display of Auto will be be automatically uploaded. If you do not like automatic, let's remove it. Log in to the window menu of artists chat, press contacts, because the candidate if you enter the name of the person you want to chat comes out as number 9, let's enter the message and press the plus button of the person you want to chat. When you press the plus button number 10 place called chat, because the name of the person you want to invite is displayed, let's invitation to enter the name of the person. Function of 12.5 just download this upload, share, and it looks complicated, but because it is a story of the only working each other, let's do because it is all right not defensive because it is a simple procedure. The is have the same thought this upload and download is Apple's music distribution. The person who was recognized among the top creators Some people to CD asked to hear the label here in the database. Pessimism Apple's delivery and fast (I am a 30-minute Toka one hour, delivery was was) or give me a work in by ear, Some who but is the values of the people think it is good, that there is no reality There are also people who become like. But it is safe to is illegally Apple higher security than those that can be downloaded such as Youtube is safe hundreds of times, also of Avid's collaboration capabilities because security is also high. Apple's music distribution, and exchange among the first sound source, because there is also a means get to hear a lot of listeners, produced in Protools12, do the upload and download in Protools each other, also be the Apple of music distribution Once the sound source is completed Let's take a look. Other delivery at Am azon is also valid but do not know be a bit time-consuming is given. I or incorporating the new OS this to the database so went pretty well at Apple, has been steadily making a song. Are not you making too much? I think, but I will not lose even if there is, so the more it is, the better. Unless it is a trash. Now to many people and collaboration in collaboration Protools12, let's fun music or delivered.</p>

<p id="calibre_link-45">About sampling</p>
<p id="calibre_link-46">While simple on using Protools also advanced players that have to be quite elaborate, it is the world of sampling. But only use side-by-side so boring, it is recommended that you want to edit from the MIDI screen. However, it seems that the number has decreased a few recently. Is it just sampling? Although there might be some people, if you do everything in the drums, you get a sense of realism, and I can not even translate into all sampling, and before sampling to Krypton's Santo and sound to the engineer It says that it is cheap because it saves my labor. I used to use it a lot before, but it seems that everything I almost wanted was bought up. In the end people who can not play instruments will not continue. It stops somewhere. A person who does not know the dre mi of the instrument can not be able to request the site quickly for the operation, and those who continue for many years certainly have the basis of the instrument. Also, I would like to introduce something fashionable, new and fresh. So is the basic operation of Protools, but read the San pudding packaging is</p>

<p id="calibre_link-186">Lyrics will be able to write that they are doing lyrics like the following for many years. It is a list of lyrics that Shinozaki Namiko wrote down. If somebody can not take care of someone already living and loving one You too important It can not be done in minutes. I remembered that Hey, I still remember it. The thing I should love from myself Hey, let's get together The continuation of a dream that should fulfill one's promise If you remember the first encounter left here that you can only do My heart has hurt, but Because you are all recognized I am not scared now. about Please leave it to mind If you always give up on yourself as usual you will be unbelievable You are also scared. I remembered that I can not forgive him</p>
<p id="calibre_link-187">Hey, you will not forget If you want to believe that you are from yourself Hey, let's get together Someday I talked about what I had talked about If you remember the last wound left in here that you only know what you are My chest became painful Because you loved me all I will not forget it now. When Please be sworn in my heart Once I remember the first encounter My heart has hurt, but Because you are all recognized I am not scared now. about Please leave it to mind Remembering the last wound My chest became painful Because you loved me all I will not forget it now. When Please be sworn in my heart</p>
<p id="calibre_link-188">Even in such a world it will not end One thing that does not change is in me I was told to tell you I have not been there until this point I only want you to understand, so I wrote it here If necessary If you do not need it you can throw it away What you were trying to convey to you is the endless feelings to you So surely I will know someday You think that? The fact that I have been working hard so far do not want to lose you One day's feelings of that day Keep running all the way Even if the end comes I will not forget that I have a feeling I do not want to forget I'm asking you If you do not ask for it, you can forget it You are asleep as you are, but I will stay that day You are shining Try asking if you get up while you are still You are the only one in my heart That's not changed But as it probably will not reach this way you When trying to remind me I will run to you I heard a voice heard somewhere and ran running all the time It was What I was about to tell you was the endless feelings to you So surely I will know someday You think that? The fact that I have been working hard so far do not want to lose you One day's feelings of that day Keep running all the way</p>
<p id="calibre_link-189">You are the only one in my heart That's not changed But as it probably will not reach this way you When trying to remind me I will run to you I heard a voice heard somewhere and ran running all the time It was Somehow it is painful as today the power has gone out very much I do not think it's gone wrong I can not move out of my way anyhow Because such a rough surreal I want you to encourage someone like that I feel like that I do not want to pass as anymore I want to put myself out all the momentum Only I do not know if I can not be shaken out and I am clear I'm not once you stop? Such easily myself to become easier If you wait too long and quit again Somehow, I lamented as if everything stopped very yesterday You'd better stop it. I am tormented by my own efforts I do not feel like this so I want someone to cheer me up If you do not end up with that kind of throwing that kind of throwing I pulled out and returned myself Want But you can not throw me I can not say unless you are clear It's not once you cool yourself in? Such misunderstanding become easier If you wait too long and quit again If it does not pass as it is because of that kind of mind I want to put myself out all the momentum Only I do not know if I can not be shaken out and I am clear I'm not once you stop? Such easily myself to become easier If you wait too long and quit again If you do not end it like that kind of throwing I pulled out and returned myself Want But you can not throw me I can not say unless you are clear It's not once you cool yourself in? Such misunderstanding become easier If you wait too long and quit again</p>
<p id="calibre_link-190">Melodies having casual faces even repeated every day The view of the scenery which is surely seen in the eyes is eternity Not even Surely the imagination that comes to mind is not fantasy I'm afraid I am lined up with such words repetition I was a back-to-back facial expression I want to keep running forever I just want to burn to the head only the real thing in front of my eyes I feel next to the real happiness next to me I also knew that everything had a purpose There were casual colored melodies replaced every day It is probably meditation beyond the back of my mind beyond my eyes Squid Surely the end of the controversy on words is not imagination I wonder if my imagination is attracted Son song Redoing I was guessing back to back I want to keep running forever I wish to line up the reality just in front of my eyes I feel distressed the suffering of reasoning while I am far away I also knew that there is no purpose in everything I want to keep running forever This is the real thing before my eyes I want to burn on my head just want to burn reality happiness next to me I know I do not have any purpose in everything I want to keep running forever I only want to keep running I just want to line up with reality in front of my eyes Feeling the distress of reasoning far away While I also learned that everything has no purpose</p>

Even when the result does not go as far as it seems Your talisman as safe as you can smile I also think I leaf? ‚Äã<br />
I wonder if I could live happily someday I am smiling softly Even if it is painful now I will not throw away hope so Even if you do your best, someone will admit it Do not lose sight of the meaning of the essence captured by the world Because there are stains and the best one seems to be chased after the pressure There is even a weak pain everyone else where Looking for a dream about someone else What you want to give I do not think anyone has no weakness though There are things that can be done somewhere The Even when I do not feel like anything freely to think anyway A revolutionary townscape like yours to laugh and spend your healing I wonder if I even think you know? ‚Äã<br />

After implantation programming like my case screen shot, Bass Drum , snare, hi-hat, we cymbals, to identify the position of Tom or the like is placed. Usually 0 position of the bass drum is often the software configuration but let's driving distinguished sounded since the arrangement each of the plug-in is different. Complex driving many cases of MIDI does not distinguish properly because typing on the screen of the editor and will mess up music.

This is if you are taken with mono have been set from the beginning to sound from nature and the center. So vocal is to take in mono. And why and I say from the center, because it so as not to be confused with the musical instrument. If taken in stereo you need to bother to center. Let's take as much as possible in mono. After the instrument has become in the right-to-left, always vocal note in there because there is a need to ensure that sound from the center, rest is perfect if Totonoere the balance (of the instrument). Sometimes sound effects, vocals may only from the only or from right to left, but the basic is from the center CD after if mixing the balance in mind that take in mono Since it has ringing sound of the compressor and EQ in It is completed by mastering. Vocal is easy When you work you, but get used to have a little bit of study. Is also a trick to keep in mind only the fact that from the center.</p>
