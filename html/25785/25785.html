<p>THE MIDNIGHT VISIT</p>
<p>by Yutaka Mitsuno</p>
<p>(Japanese in Japan)</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>CHAPTER Ôºë</p>
<p>„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ The Chance Encounter</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>It was a summer night when Taro met her and her brother. Taro had wondered why she had been looking in his direction. So he had made up his mind to visit her.</p>
<p>"Are you a good boy or not?"</p>
<p>These were the first words she said after Taro landed on the roof . She was sitting with her arms resting on the window sill.</p>
<p>"Maybe...I'm good, but..."</p>
<p>"But?"</p>
<p>"Why aren't you surprised to see me?"</p>
<p>"Because I often see spirits."</p>
<p>"Spirits?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"I'm not a spirit."</p>
<p>"What are you, then?"</p>
<p>"I'm a human being."</p>
<p>"I don't believe you. The thing is, you've come from the sky, haven't you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but... anyway why were you looking at me?"</p>
<p>"You? I was just looking at the Milky Way."</p>
<p>"Oh, I've made a serious mistake."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Well, my telescope happened to turn on to you. So I thought you were interested in me."</p>
<p>"Could you see me from the Milky Way?"</p>
<p>"Umm, not the Milky Way. From outer space, near the moon. I'm staying there. And I have a special telescope."</p>
<p>"Are you an alien, then?"</p>
<p>"No, I'm a human being. I said so before."</p>
<p>"Oh, sorry. So what's your name?</p>
<p>"I'm Taro."</p>
<p>"Isn't that a Japanese name?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it is. I'm Japanese."</p>
<p>"But you don't look Japanese."</p>
<p>"I know. But Atoa told me I was."</p>
<p>"Atoa?"</p>
<p>"She is my mother...no, she is my friend."</p>
<p>"Your girl friend?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Which is she?"</p>
<p>"Uh, she is just my friend."</p>
<p>"OK. I'm Larissa. Nice to meet you."</p>
<p>"Nice to meet you, too."</p>
<p>From the first floor window she reached down her hand to the boy who stood on the ground floor roof. He took her hand and they shook hands.</p>
<p>"Are you staying there?" Larissa pointed the moon.</p>
<p>"Yes, but more accurately between the earth and the moon. We have a space ship."</p>
<p>"What do you do usually?"</p>
<p>"I watch everything on the earth."</p>
<p>"What do you mean everything?"</p>
<p>"For example, human relationships, family dynamics, all kinds of art‚Äï"</p>
<p>"You sound like a scholar."</p>
<p>"No, I'm just a kid. I don't like studying."</p>
<p>"But you look sharp."</p>
<p>"You think so?" Taro blushed.</p>
<p>"Yeah, you must be clever because you have a lot of knowledge."</p>
<p>"No, you have a misunderstanding about me," Taro added sorrowfully, "I don't know much about the earth or human beings, although I'm human."</p>
<p>They fell silent for an instant. Larissa had just hit on a good idea.</p>
<p>"I'll tell you about TV programs and Kitty, Micky Mouse, Pocket Monster."</p>
<p>Taro's eyes widened in surprise, "Thank you, Larissa, but I‚Äï."</p>
<p>"And I can tell you about my teacher, my daddy and mummy, my‚Äï."</p>
<p>Then a boy came into the room. He looked older than Larissa.</p>
<p>"What are you talking to this time?"</p>
<p>"Daniel! I got a friend. Now we are‚Äï."</p>
<p>"Shut up!" he said as he marched up to her at the window, "I've told you before not to talk to‚Äï."</p>
<p>Suddenly he went silent and stared at Taro.</p>
<p>"Are you a ghost?" he said falteringly, "Or am I mental?"</p>
<p>"No," Taro said, "You are quite sane."</p>
<p>Larissa said to her brother, "Taro is Japanese. He is a common boy."</p>
<p>"I can't understand what's going on," he added, "Why is he standing on the roof?"</p>
<p>Larissa explained the course of things. And he finally accepted the situation.</p>
<p>"I see. Nice to meet you. I'm Daniel," he said and bowed.</p>
<p>Taro recollected that Japanese people bowed.</p>
<p>"Nice to meet you, too." He bowed in turn.</p>
<p>"But," Daniel asked, "how did you get here?"</p>
<p>"Well, it was easy. I came through a tunnel."</p>
<p>"A tunnel? On foot?"</p>
<p>"No, there's no need to walk. The entrance and the exit almost stick together, besides the space inside the tunnel moves."</p>
<p>"But...where's the tunnel?"</p>
<p>"It's usually invisible."</p>
<p>"So how did you build it?"</p>
<p>"Build? I don't know. I just point a beam at the place I want to go."</p>
<p>"Ah, it must be a super machine."</p>
<p>Then Larissa interrupted them, "Do you have many super machines?"</p>
<p>"I don't know what a super machine is," said Taro.</p>
<p>"I mean ‚Äï."</p>
<p>"Be quiet. I'm talking to him." Daniel said and turned to Taro, "We don't have such machines which make tunnels and telescopes by which you can see a window from outer space."</p>
<p>"But," Taro replied, "We don't have the machinery a dentist uses."</p>
<p>"You go to a dentist on the earth, then?"</p>
<p>"No, I don't go to any dentist's."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"We don't get bad teeth."</p>
<p>"That's wonderful!" Larissa said.</p>
<p>"Be quiet," Daniel said and turned to Taro again, "Why don't you get bad teeth?"</p>
<p>"I heard I was given medicine once when I was a child.</p>
<p>"Marvelous!" Larissa shouted, "I want some!"</p>
<p>"Shut up! Don't be cheeky!"</p>
<p>Larissa was about to cry.</p>
<p>"OK, no problem." Daniel thought he had said too much, "You can ask Taro."</p>
<p>"If you give me the medicine," Larissa said, "I'll give you my Pocket Monster soft toy."</p>
<p>"Uh, Larissa," Taro said, "I'm not allowed to give people on earth anything."</p>
<p>"Oh, no."</p>
<p>Daniel said to her, "You have to give up."</p>
<p>"OK. But I'll give him my Pocket Monster so that he won't forget me."</p>
<p>"Uh, very sorry, Larissa," Taro said again, "I'm not allowed to accept anything, either."</p>
<p>"Oh..."</p>
<p>Daniel said to her, "Don't bother him."</p>
<p>Taro thought for a moment and said, "I'll make an exception and ask Atoa to give me the medicine for you."</p>
<p>"You don't have to. Instead, would you come here again?"</p>
<p>"Of course!" Taro replied, "That would be the best present for me!"</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Well...the truth is I don't have any friends."</p>
<p>"You said you have a friend in your space ship."</p>
<p>"Actually she is also my mother, although I don't like to admit it."</p>
<p>"I think a mother and a friend are different."</p>
<p>"Sorry, Larissa, but I don't want you to ask me more about that."</p>
<p>"Haw..."</p>
<p>Daniel cut in, "Larissa, Taro has things he doesn't want to talk about."</p>
<p>"I know. I was just talking."</p>
<p>Taro tried to change the subject and said, "You both go to school, don't you?"</p>
<p>"No, I'm going to school next year," Larissa replied, "Daniel is in the fifth grade."</p>
<p>"I have never been to school," Taro said, "I envy you, Daniel."</p>
<p>"You can go with Daniel," Larissa said.</p>
<p>Daniel replied, "You don't know anything about his circumstances." And he asked Taro, "Do you really want to go school?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I do. But your school won't permit that."</p>
<p>"Why won't they?" Larissa asked.</p>
<p>"I was not born on the earth, so I don't have any of the rights common people have."</p>
<p>"Uh...but," said Daniel, "I don't want you to go to school."</p>
<p>"Why not?" Taro asked this time.</p>
<p>"Because there's often a lot of trouble at school. I don't want you to see any of it."</p>
<p>"Trouble? What kind of trouble?"</p>
<p>"For example, although I don't want to say...bullying, violence, cheating and things like that."</p>
<p>"I think on the earth there will always be some trouble wherever pupils are."</p>
<p>"Um, but this is different from what you might think."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"For instance, some pupils are bullied, even when they have done nothing wrong."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"I don't know."</p>
<p>"You don't know? I can't understand. I think it's common that someone steps in when that happens."</p>
<p>"If someone does, they could be bullied, too."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Uh...sorry, Taro, but I don't want to say any more about that."</p>
<p>"OK, Daniel. Ur, it's time. I must be going back now."</p>
<p>"No, I wanna keep talking." Larissa said.</p>
<p>"Don't be so selfish," Daniel told her.</p>
<p>"But I want Taro to tell me more about the planets, stars and his spaceship."</p>
<p>Taro said to her, "Larissa, I'll come here again and tell you about those things. I promise."</p>
<p>"Can I trust you?"</p>
<p>"Of course."</p>
<p>"When will you come."</p>
<p>"Hmm, sometime next week."</p>
<p>"Not tomorrow, then. Are you busy?"</p>
<p>"A little bit. And I also have to study."</p>
<p>"I see. Me, too."</p>
<p>"Good night, then."</p>
<p>"Good night, Taro," both of them said at the same time.</p>
<p>No sooner had he turned around than his figure faded away.</p>
<p>*„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ *</p>
<p>Night after night, Larissa waited for Taro, but he still hadn't appeared. And it was the seventh night at last.</p>
<p>"I wonder if Taro will come after all," Larissa said to herself, looking up the dark clear sky.</p>
<p>"He'll keep his promise," Daniel said reassuringly while standing next to Larissa by the window.</p>
<p>"What do you think he studies about when he is in his space ship?"</p>
<p>"Maybe about cultures on the earth and how we feel about things, stuff like that."</p>
<p>"Oh, is that a shooting star, Daniel?"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Look over there! The star is moving!" Larissa pointed at it.</p>
<p>The sparkling object headed straight for them, all the while getting bigger and bigger. And when it was about to bump into them, it suddenly faded out. The next moment Taro emerged out of the darkness. Like the time before, he was standing on the roof.</p>
<p>"Hi, how have you been?" Taro greeted them.</p>
<p>"I've been waiting for you every night!" Larissa exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Sorry, Larissa, but I've been busy...you know, a battle broke out in the Middle East. I went there to investigate it."</p>
<p>"I didn't take any notice of it," Daniel said, "because battles break out around there all the time."</p>
<p>"I don't know why people on the earth kill each other. What profit do they get from it?"</p>
<p>"Er...I'd like to tell you, but I also don't know."</p>
<p>"I know why," said Larissa, "Because most people can't be tolerant of the others and...and because most people think their opinions, ideas, religions are the correct ones."</p>
<p>Daniel and Taro gazed at her.</p>
<p>Larissa added, "I heard someone say that on TV."</p>
<p>"Larissa," Daniel told her, "you should only say things you can grasp the meaning of."</p>
<p>"I can understand what it means!"</p>
<p>"I'm not going to tell you again. Keep quiet, or I'll make you cry."</p>
<p>"I hate you, Daniel!"</p>
<p>"Er, Larissa," said Taro, "I'm sure what you said is true, but I can't for the life of me understand who benefits from killing. In the case of unicorns, if they fought one another, they would have died out, because the males have long sharp horns. But they have never battled, instead, they've compared the length of their horns. By the way many countries on the earth have large numbers of nuclear bombs now. Do you think they will limit themselves to only comparing their nuclear arsenals?"</p>
<p>"They have already been used," Daniel said.</p>
<p>"I've studied that," Taro replied, "two cities in Japan were bombed, weren't they?"</p>
<p>"Yes. The first bomb killed over a hundred thousand people in Hiroshima. Americans must be villains!"</p>
<p>"But, Daniel," said Taro, "The Japanese army killed millions of people in China and other Asian countries."</p>
<p>"Really? Why haven't I learnt that at school?"</p>
<p>"Er, I suppose that," Taro said thoughtfully, "the Japanese government doesn't want people to know the truth."</p>
<p>"What a notion! I can't understand why."</p>
<p>"Almost all governments in the world are like that."</p>
<p>"That's unbelievable!"</p>
<p>Then Larissa said, "So teachers tell us lies."</p>
<p>"Er, Larissa," Taro replied, "they actually want to tell the truth, but they are under their boss's watch."</p>
<p>"I don't want to go to elementary school. There are bullies, and teachers tell lies...I want to study with you, Taro. Can I go to your space ship?"</p>
<p>Daniel told her, "Larissa, you are impudent!"</p>
<p>Taro said, "Sorry, Larissa, I can't take you there, although I would like to."</p>
<p>"No, don't mind it." Larissa said and turned to Daniel, "I was only asking."</p>
<p>Taro said to her, "OK, er...instead of that, I'll give you the medicine you wanted."</p>
<p>Taro took a capsule out of his breast pocket.</p>
<p>"Will you promise never to tell anyone about this?"</p>
<p>"Of course. I'll never tell anyone. I like you, Taro."</p>
<p>"Sorry," Taro said to Daniel, "It was difficult to bring another one for you."</p>
<p>"Don't worry. My teeth are very strong."</p>
<p>"That's good." Taro said and he changed the topic, "By the way, you guys don't look Japanese, especially you, Larissa."</p>
<p>They both giggled.</p>
<p>"Our father is British," Larissa answered, "and our mother is Japanese."</p>
<p>"Oh, you are half and half."</p>
<p>"Anyway you said before you were Japanese," Daniel replied, "So why are you staying in a space ship?"</p>
<p>"Er, the truth is I've been on a journey through out the universe."</p>
<p>"What!" Daniel and Larissa cried out at the same time.</p>
<p>"What is the farthest place you've been to?" asked Larissa.</p>
<p>"Here."</p>
<p>"Here? What do you mean?" asked Daniel.</p>
<p>"I mean that I left here, rounded the universe and arrived back here."</p>
<p>"I don't understand very well."</p>
<p>"Cosmic space is bent itself, so if you go straight from here, eventually you will return here."</p>
<p>"Then how long did it take?"</p>
<p>"About one hundred million years, according to my mother."</p>
<p>"WHAT? A HUNDRED MILLION YEARS!"</p>
<p>Daniel fell silent. But Larissa asked, "How old are you, then?"</p>
<p>"I haven't been alive long this time."</p>
<p>"This time?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I've been reincarnated many times."</p>
<p>"Really."</p>
<p>"And my life span is very long compared with humans on the earth."</p>
<p>"OK, so when is your birthday?"</p>
<p>"I have so many."</p>
<p>"Many? Why many?"</p>
<p>"Many lives, many birthdays."</p>
<p>"Oh!"</p>
<p>Daniel cut in, "I can't follow you, Taro."</p>
<p>Larissa said, "I can't follow you, Taro."</p>
<p>"Don't imitate me."</p>
<p>"I wasn't."</p>
<p>"Anyway," Daniel got back to the topic, "how old are you in this life?"</p>
<p>Larissa blamed Daniel, "Now you are imitating me."</p>
<p>"Shut up!"</p>
<p>Taro said, "I'll tell you some day, because you won't believe me if I tell you now."</p>
<p>"Oh, you mean you are very old, don't you?" Daniel asked.</p>
<p>"Uh, age doesn't mean young or old for us."</p>
<p>"I can't understand. Everyone around here is getting old."</p>
<p>"But it is just a number. The important thing is what wisdom people gain in their lives. Some gain it soon and some spend much time to do it."</p>
<p>"You have a different way of looking at age, don't you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, like I said age is not important, what important is what their spirits have gained."</p>
<p>Larissa cut in, "I've heard about that."</p>
<p>"From who?" Daniel asked.</p>
<p>"Grandma."</p>
<p>"You haven't talked to her. She died when you were a baby."</p>
<p>"Yes, I have. Many times!"</p>
<p>"That's not true!"</p>
<p>"She sometimes visits me!"</p>
<p>"Rubbish!" Daniel said and he turned to Taro, "She often talks to spirits. It's weird. What do you think of spirits?"</p>
<p>"Do you want to ask me if spirits exist or not?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I do."</p>
<p>"I think both are right."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Everything in existence has its own wave. And our thoughts make various kinds of waves. If you make a wave that accords with the wave of a spirit, you will be able to see it. Unless you are on the same wave, you won't be able to see it."</p>
<p>"That's pretty difficult for me to understand."</p>
<p>"I think there is a bias on the earth against people who believe in spirits. That prevents understanding."</p>
<p>"That's right!" Larissa shouted, "Daniel hates me talking to spirits, although he doesn't know anything about them."</p>
<p>Daniel stared at her, embarrassed.</p>
<p>"Nobody can believe that," Taro told her, "as long as they haven't met any."</p>
<p>"They are just like us. I can't understand why people can't see them."</p>
<p>"I know how you feel, but the number of people who can't see them are greater than the people who can."</p>
<p>"So you can see them?"</p>
<p>"Yes. But I don't usually try to."</p>
<p>"Can you also 'not see' them?"</p>
<p>"Um...I can emit and catch some kinds of waves like a TV has so many cannels."</p>
<p>"It's convenient to able to see and not to see!"</p>
<p>"You will be able to do that, too."</p>
<p>"Really? How?"</p>
<p>"You have to find the way. Ah...sorry, Larissa, but I must be going now."</p>
<p>"OK. I want to talk to you more. When will you come again?"</p>
<p>"I can't tell you because I have a lot of things I have to investigate."</p>
<p>"I see you are busy. And...may I ask a favour of you?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Go ahead."</p>
<p>"Do you have a way you can inform us before you come?"</p>
<p>"I might have."</p>
<p>"Do you have a mobile phone, then?"</p>
<p>Daniel cut in, "Larissa, don't talk nonsense."</p>
<p>"I think," Taro answered her, "We could send words mind to mind."</p>
<p>"We have the same waves?"</p>
<p>"I'm going to find out your wave."</p>
<p>"Would you?"</p>
<p>"You have my word, Larissa. Good night, then."</p>
<p>The two said at the same time, "Good night, Taro."</p>

<p>CHAPTER 2</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>The Trip to London</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>Larissa wasn't expecting Taro this time. One week was too long for her to wait. So she tried to live as usual.„ÄÄIn her kindergarten a big event was coming up. She had to practice for the school play every day. Her role was princess Otohime in 'URASHIMA TARO' which is one of the most famous folk tales in Japan.</p>
<p>It was the night two days before the play would take place. Larissa was feeling uneasy. Then she heard a faint voice.</p>
<p>"Who? What are you saying?"</p>
<p>"Larissa, will you help me?"</p>
<p>"Is that you, Taro?"</p>
<p>"Yes. It's me."</p>
<p>"What's the matter?"</p>
<p>"Your cousin Sophia is in danger, and so is her mother and father."</p>
<p>"Where are they?"</p>
<p>"They are in London."</p>
<p>"But they live in Northern Ireland."</p>
<p>"I know. They are on their way to Sophia's uncle's house in Bristol. They are going to take the tube."</p>
<p>"So what's dangerous about that?"</p>
<p>"The train will be blown to bits."</p>
<p>"Oh, God! They are going to die?"</p>
<p>"Probably."</p>
<p>Larissa was about to cry.</p>
<p>"Don't worry. I think you can stop them."</p>
<p>"How?"</p>
<p>"You must speak to Sophia. Secretly."</p>
<p>"But how? I'm in Japan, you know."</p>
<p>"I've made a tunnel, so you can come here soon."</p>
<p>"But I...ah, OK, I'll come."</p>
<p>The next moment a bright ball emerged outside by the window and got bigger and bigger. When it became the size of an oil drum, a hole opened at the centre.</p>
<p>"Come here, Larissa."</p>
<p>She heard Taro's voice but she hesitated to enter.</p>
<p>"Come on!"</p>
<p>"Taro, are you near here?"</p>
<p>"No. I'm in London. Didn't I tell you?"</p>
<p>"No, you didn't. Your voice sounds so near. I don't think‚Äï"</p>
<p>Suddenly Taro's arm came out of the hole.</p>
<p>"Take my hand!"</p>
<p>Larissa grasped it, and in an instant she was drawn into the hole. The next moment she was in London.</p>
<p>"Where are we?"</p>
<p>"We are opposite the tube station. You must run after your relatives."</p>
<p>"What shall I say?"</p>
<p>"Whisper something to Sophia."</p>
<p>"How can I do that?"</p>
<p>"You may use this."</p>
<p>Taro took out a thin cylinder like a Japanese recorder and handed it to her.</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"Turn one end of this towards Sophia until you can see a red dot of light, and speak to her from the other end."</p>
<p>"I see. But what shall I tell her?"</p>
<p>"Look!" he pointed at a girl.</p>
<p>"Oh, that's Sophie."</p>
<p>"Run after her, now!"</p>
<p>"But what‚Äï."</p>
<p>"Just go! Don't lose her!"</p>
<p>Larissa started to run. Sophia was walking with her parents either side of her. Larissa approached Sophia, gripping the cylinder. Before they entered the station she tried to aim the red dot on Sophia's dress. But she couldn't see the dot.</p>
<p>"Good heavens!" Larissa noticed, "Her dress is red, too!"</p>
<p>Too late. They had passed through the sliding doors.</p>
<p>"What shall I do?" Larissa said to herself. She remembered that unless she stopped them, they would die.</p>
<p>"I have to keep trying."</p>
<p>She aimed the cylinder at them. The red dot moved up and down on Sophia's mother.</p>
<p>"OK. A little bit to..."</p>
<p>With the red dot now on Sophia, she whispered, "Stop, please."</p>
<p>Sophia didn't react.</p>
<p>"Stop, Sophie!" Larissa said in a slightly louder voice.</p>
<p>Sophia looked around. Wow, Larissa thought. It seemed to work. Then an idea hit her.</p>
<p>"Ask to go to the ladies' room."</p>
<p>Sophia stopped walking and looked up at her mother. Larissa hid behind a column and watched her say something. But they continued towards the ticket machine. Larissa quickly followed them.</p>
<p>Her uncle was about to buy tickets from the machine.</p>
<p>"Oh, God!" Larissa uttered and in spite of herself started to run towards her uncle. Her aunt and Sophia were standing next to her uncle with their backs to Larissa. When she was on the verge of charging her uncle, Sophia suddenly moved to behind her father. Larissa bumped into her. They fell down, crashing their heads on the marble floor.</p>
<p>"OUCH!" Sophia yelled and started to cry.</p>
<p>Larissa quickly stood up.</p>
<p>"Sorry," and without looking at them ran away.</p>
<p>"Hey, you!" her uncle shouted after her. He didn't chase her. He raised Sophia in his arms.</p>
<p>Larissa went out of the station entrance and found Taro standing on the opposite side of the street.</p>
<p>"I did it," Larissa said under her breath when she got to him.</p>
<p>"You did it? She just cried."</p>
<p>"Yes, but once she cries, she doesn't stop for ages."</p>
<p>"They won't get on the train, then?"</p>
<p>"No. They will probably spend quarter or half an hour there."</p>
<p>"Oh, good. The train leaves in five minutes."</p>
<p>"But I want you to make sure they don't get on. I'll wait here."</p>
<p>"Uh...OK, but you have to go back to your home now."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Your father is coming to your room soon."</p>
<p>"Dad?"</p>
<p>"Yes. He is a little drunk and he wants to say good night to you."</p>
<p>"Oh, no! If I'm not there, he will call the police."</p>
<p>"I'll make a tunnel. Let's go somewhere quiet."</p>
<p>*„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ *</p>
<p>Larissa got back to her room safely. Soon she had a visit from her father who gave her a lovely kiss scented with beer. And after that her brother secretly came in. She gabbled to him the whole story hastily like a machine gun.</p>
<p>The next morning her mother called to her children loudly from downstairs. They went to the living room.</p>
<p>"I have some big news," their mother said excitedly, "I just had a call from your aunt. She and her family were on their way to relatives in Bristol. They had to take a tube to Victoria station, but the tube was blown up."</p>
<p>Larissa and Daniel were lost for words.</p>
<p>"But they were safe."</p>
<p>"How come?" asked Daniel.</p>
<p>"They were just about to get the tube," Mother went on, "but in the station a strange girl bumped into Sophie. Sophie struck her head on the floor and started crying. So they couldn't get on the tube."</p>
<p>Larissa didn't know how to react. She asked her mother timidly, "So who was the strange girl?"</p>
<p>"Apparently Sophie thought the girl was you, Larissa. But there was no way you could have been there. Anyway it doesn't matter because they were OK."</p>
<p>Larissa felt in her heart that she had done it, she had really saved them. Yes, yes, yes.</p>

<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>The Warning</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>Saturday night came. Larissa couldn't sleep because she was filled with excitement as the school plays were taking place the next day. She had been practicing for her play the whole month.</p>
<p>There was a light knock on the window. She sat up and listened. Then came two more knocks. It must be Taro, she thought. She stood up and turned on the bedside lamp.</p>
<p>"Is that you, Taro?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it's me. Open the window."</p>
<p>"OK, hang on a sec." She went to the window and opened it. "What's up?"</p>
<p>"I've got more bad news."</p>
<p>"What is it this time?"</p>
<p>"There's a major earthquake coming."</p>
<p>"Where will it be?"</p>
<p>"Here."</p>
<p>"HERE!"</p>
<p>"Sh."</p>
<p>"When?"</p>
<p>"It's better I don't tell you because you'll get uneasy and you might panic."</p>
<p>"I hope it's not tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"Because our school plays are tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Are you in one?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm playing Princess Otohime in the old tale of URASHIMA TARO."</p>
<p>"What! URASHIMA TARO?"</p>
<p>"Oh, it's the same name as yours. Do you know it?"</p>
<p>"Of course! That's me!"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Well, he WAS me."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"It's difficult to explain."</p>
<p>"Please tell me."</p>
<p>"Ah...a long long time ago I lived in Japan. One day I rescued a young woman who had lain at a beach. In gratitude she took me to her planet in her space ship. I stayed for three years and came back. But on the earth six hundred years had passed. I was shocked and got old quickly and died.</p>
<p>I was born on the earth again. At that time I was an astronaut. I stayed on the moon for a year. When I came back to the earth, I had an accident and my space ship began to stray. Atoa found my space ship by chance and rescued me. After that we visited many planets together to learn all of the things in the universe. Along the way I went through many reincarnations.</p>
<p>At last we made up our minds to go back to the earth."</p>
<p>"How come?"</p>
<p>"Because I wanted to go to the ages I had lived in."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"The truth is time loops. So the end of time connects to the beginning of it."</p>
<p>"Uh, this world is the second one, then?"</p>
<p>"That's right. The two worlds are not perfectly the same, though."</p>
<p>"I see. So you left the earth a hundred million years ago, I get that."</p>
<p>"The globe repeats its own history."</p>
<p>"OK."</p>
<p>Then Daniel came into her room, "What are you two talking about?"</p>
<p>"Daniel, listen. Taro lived in Japan a hundred million years ago"</p>
<p>Taro said, "Good evening, Daniel."</p>
<p>"Good evening," Daniel replied and said, "There were no humans then."</p>
<p>"So that's why I didn't want to say," Taro said.</p>
<p>Larissa told Daniel, "Don't butt in. This is our talk."</p>
<p>"Oh, VERY sorry, princess."</p>
<p>"Who are you calling princess? I hate you!"</p>
<p>"Take it easy, guys," Taro said, "I have something to tell you."</p>
<p>"Is it about the earthquake?" asked Larissa.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"What earthquake?" Daniel asked Larissa.</p>
<p>"There's going to be a big earthquake."</p>
<p>"Where?"</p>
<p>Taro told him, "Here."</p>
<p>"What!"</p>
<p>"And soon."</p>
<p>"Oh, my God!"</p>
<p>Larissa said, "I must go and tell mummy this," she was about go to the living room.</p>
<p>"Wait," Daniel stopped her, "Mum won't believe such a thing. And you have to reveal who Taro is to make her believe you."</p>
<p>"What shall we do, then?"</p>
<p>"How about we go for a trip before it happens?"</p>
<p>Then Taro asked, "How will you persuade your parents?"</p>
<p>Larissa said, "I don't think Dad takes holidays on weekdays."</p>
<p>"Me, neither," Daniel said, "but we have to try. I'll ask Mum tomorrow." And he turned to Taro, "Do you know the day?"</p>
<p>"I know approximately."</p>
<p>"Would you tell me?"</p>
<p>"Within three days from next Wednesday."</p>
<p>"Oh, we have very little time."</p>
<p>Larissa shouted, "That's good timing! I can still appear in the play."</p>
<p>"You idiot! That's insignificant compared to a major earthquake."</p>
<p>"Beast! You don't know how much I've practiced!"</p>
<p>"Larissa," said Taro, "May I go to see your play tomorrow?"</p>
<p>"You want to come?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I wanna see it."</p>
<p>"That's great!"</p>
<p>"But we can't speak at the kindergarten."</p>
<p>"No, of course not."</p>
<p>"And now it's time. I have to go back."</p>
<p>"OK. I'm looking forward to tomorrow. Good night."</p>
<p>"Me, too," Taro turned to Daniel and said, "Good night."</p>
<p>"Good night, Taro. I might go and see her play, too."</p>
<p>"OK. Bye, then."</p>
<p>*„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ *</p>
<p>Larissa stood in the wings waiting to go on stage. She was going to play Princess Otohime in the kindergarten's version of 'Urashima Taro'. She tried to look for Taro among the audience but she couldn't find him, because there were so many people.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the play, there were several children on the stage. They were bullying a turtle they had caught. Then TARO appeared on the stage with a fishing rod and rescued it from the children. The turtle thanked him and went back into the sea.</p>
<p>The lights went out briefly and TARO appeared again. He sat on a rock with his fishing rod. Then the turtle emerged out of the sea.</p>
<p>The turtle said, "Thank you very much for rescuing me the other day."</p>
<p>TARO replied, "You're welcome."</p>
<p>The turtle said again, "Princess Otohime wishes to invite you to Ryugu castle. Do you accept?"</p>
<p>"I'm glad to hear that."</p>
<p>"Please ride on my back."</p>
<p>TARO rode on its back and sank among waves behind the rock.</p>
<p>In the next scene Taro was sitting on the throne next to Princess Otohime. In front of them many kinds of fish were dancing. He was drinking from a sake cup.</p>
<p>TARO said, "What a beautiful dance! And how delicious this sake is!"</p>
<p>The stage became dark and then light. It signified that the feast continued day after day.</p>
<p>The narration went, "TARO had a wonderful stay in the Ryugu castle and before he knew it three years had passed."</p>
<p>In the feast TARO said to himself, "I'm a little tired. Oh, how are my parents?" he turned to Otohime, "I have to go back home."</p>
<p>Otohime said, "You don't have to go back. You feel happy here, don't you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but I'm concerned about my parents."</p>
<p>"You have to go back no matter what?"</p>
<p>"Yes, no matter what."</p>
<p>"I see," Otohime brought a small luxurious box, "I'll give you this box. Please never open it."</p>
<p>"OK. Thank you for your hospitality."</p>
<p>The stage went dark. The next scene took place in a village. TARO was standing with the box by a rice field.</p>
<p>"Where has my house gone? And the whole neighbourhood, too? Hundreds of years must have passed."</p>
<p>He sat down on some weeds and put the box in front of him.</p>
<p>"Why, Otohime? Why did you do this to me?"</p>
<p>He tried to open the box.</p>
<p>"What's in it?"</p>
<p>Finally he opened the box. And white smoke rose up from it. TARO hung his head.</p>
<p>"Oh, my God!"</p>
<p>His hair had turned gray and he had a gray beard.</p>
<p>"Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"</p>
<p>Deep lines carved into his face.</p>
<p>Larissa watched the performance from the wings. Then she spotted Taro. He was weeping.</p>
<p>"I wonder what's wrong?" Larissa said to herself. She descended the stairs of the right wing and went into the auditorium. Taro saw her coming. He stood up and ran for one of the exits. Seeing him run away, she chased after him. At the end of the passage Larissa cried, "Wait, Taro."</p>
<p>He looked back and slowed to a jog. He made sure no one was around and then stopped.</p>
<p>"Why were you weeping, Taro?</p>
<p>He fastened his eyes on her.</p>
<p>Larissa went on, "I know I shouldn't have spoken to you. Sorry, Taro. But..."</p>
<p>"No, I'm not worried about that. It's just that scene reminded me of my old life."</p>
<p>Then Daniel called them, "Hey, you two."</p>
<p>"Daniel!" Larissa said, "I didn't notice you were there."</p>
<p>"I saw you chase after Taro, so I followed you," Daniel said and turned to Taro, "Anyway I didn't know you were the hero in URASHIMA TARO."</p>
<p>"You had a bitter experience in your past life," Larissa said to Taro, "I wonder what my past lives were like."</p>
<p>"Maybe Taro can tell you," said Daniel.</p>
<p>"Can you?" Larissa asked Taro.</p>
<p>"Ah, I think I shouldn't answer that."</p>
<p>"It means you can, then."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, but I can't talk about that. Anyway have you persuaded your parents?"</p>
<p>"Oh, about the trip? Daniel asked Mummy."</p>
<p>Daniel said, "Dad is going to go away on business from Tuesday to Friday."</p>
<p>"So?"</p>
<p>"Now it's going to be easier to persuade Mum."</p>
<p>"You haven't asked her to go on a trip yet?"</p>
<p>"No, I'm looking for a chance to ask."</p>
<p>"I see. Good luck. And now I have to go back."</p>
<p>"Ah, it's time?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"How will you go back? Through a tunnel?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I have to search for a place no one goes to."</p>
<p>Daniel said, "I know a place. There's a bush on the hill behind this school."</p>
<p>"You know well," Taro replied with smile, "I made the tunnel there when I came."</p>
<p>The three laughed at once.</p>
<p>"See you," said Taro.</p>
<p>"See you soon," said Larissa and Daniel.</p>
<p>*„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ *</p>
<p>In the evening the two children asked their mother to take them on a trip.</p>
<p>"Why do you suddenly want to go on a trip?" she asked them.</p>
<p>"We haven't been anywhere recently," Daniel answered, "We'd really like to go a hot spring."</p>
<p>"What...are you an old man now?"</p>
<p>"Well, since Daddy is going away on business, won't you say OK?</p>
<p>Larissa chimed in, "I want to go to a hot spring, too."</p>
<p>"I'll ask again, tell me the real reason," Mother looked a little bit angry.</p>
<p>"We just want go somewhere," said Daniel falteringly.</p>
<p>"You two have to go to school on weekdays. Wait until the summer holidays. They're coming soon."</p>
<p>"It must be this week!" Larissa said impatiently.</p>
<p>"Hold your tongue," Daniel told.</p>
<p>"Something's odd. Hmm, you two are concealing something, aren't you?"</p>
<p>"No, nothing. We just want go on a trip."</p>
<p>"I don't believe you, Daniel."</p>
<p>"For God's sake, Mummy," said Larissa.</p>
<p>Their mother was silent for a while, then said, "OK, if you tell me the real reason, I'll take you on a trip."</p>
<p>"Yes!" Larissa shouted.</p>
<p>But Daniel said hesitatingly, "I promised not to tell.</p>
<p>Mother demanded, "Tell me, or I won't take you."</p>
<p>"Ah, my friend said an earthquake was going to happen here."</p>
<p>"An earthquake? How does he know that?"</p>
<p>Larissa said, "He has a super machine."</p>
<p>"Really? What is the machine like, then?"</p>
<p>"Mm..."</p>
<p>Daniel said, "She hasn't seen it. He has the ability to know the near future."</p>
<p>"Who is he?"</p>
<p>"I don't know well."</p>
<p>"You don't know?"</p>
<p>"But everything he has said has come true so far."</p>
<p>"I asked who he was. What's his name?</p>
<p>Larissa was about to cry.</p>
<p>"His name is...," Daniel started to answer, but Larissa shook her head, "Taro."</p>
<p>"And his family name?"</p>
<p>Daniel shrugged.</p>
<p>"You don't know?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"So where does he live?"</p>
<p>"Stop, please!" Larissa cried out.</p>
<p>"What's the matter, Larissa?"</p>
<p>"Don't ask us any more, Mummy, please. If we tell others about him, he won't meet us."</p>
<p>"I just want to know what's what."</p>
<p>Daniel said, "Ah, Mum, he probably has a particular situation that he doesn't want known. So we don't know a lot about him."</p>
<p>"That's it," Larissa said, "Mummy, if you take us, I'll never ask you again for anything." She was sobbing.</p>
<p>"OK, Larissa," Mother crouched down to nestle her, "Don't cry. You told the truth, so I'll take you on a trip."</p>
<p>"Really, Mummy?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Do you promise?"</p>
<p>"Have I ever broken a promise?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Well then."</p>
<p>*„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ*</p>
<p>Tuesday evening Larissa, Daniel and their mother left their home.</p>
<p>"Daddy asked why did it have to be today," Mother said as she drove, "and he said if it was the weekend, he could have gone with us."</p>
<p>"Did you talk to Daddy on the phone?" Daniel asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, but I didn't tell him I took lots of clothes, the bankbooks and seals, a pile of cash and my jewellery. If I had, he would have wanted to know why."</p>
<p>The two children looked at each other but said nothing. They turned into the motorway and headed north. Daniel knew his father was in Sapporo which is a big city located in the centre of the northern island of Hokkaido. He had asked his mother to go to a hot spring in the north. But she said Sapporo was too far, so they agreed to go to Sendai which is located half way between Tokyo and Sapporo.</p>
<p>"It's a long way there. You know I don't like driving."</p>
<p>Their mother complained all the way. In actual fact she found the children's story hard to believe. Larissa and Daniel became weary of her complaining but they put up with it.</p>
<p>*„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ *</p>
<p>The next morning Daniel got up early.</p>
<p>"Get up, Larissa. Mum and I have had a hot spring bath already."</p>
<p>He pulled away her quilt.</p>
<p>"I'm still sleepy."</p>
<p>"Do you know where you are?"</p>
<p>"Hang on." Larissa leapt out of bed. "We are at the hotel? I don't remember arriving here last night."</p>
<p>"You were out for the count."</p>
<p>"I should have met Taro last nig...oh, he doesn't know we are here!"</p>
<p>"He will probably find us if he has anything to ask."</p>
<p>"OK, but I have something important to ask him."</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"Don't you know?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"We must ask him to tell all of the people in Tokyo that there's going to be a big earthquake soon."</p>
<p>"I couldn't afford to think about that as I have been busy persuading Mummy."</p>
<p>"I'm sure he'll do that."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid he won't."</p>
<p>"Why not? He can do anything."</p>
<p>Daniel thought a little and said, "Don't you remember? He mustn't do anything like that. We are lucky that Taro happened to spot you with his telescope."</p>
<p>"But many people will die," tears started to well in her eyes.</p>
<p>"It can't be helped."</p>
<p>"I'll try to ask him."</p>
<p>"I know how you feel, Larissa. But even if he could, most people wouldn't believe him."</p>
<p>"What shall we do?"</p>
<p>"I don't know."</p>
<p>Then they felt a rude shock beneath them. The room was shaken up and down repeatedly. The strong force seemed to shake the whole hotel.</p>
<p>"What's happening?" mumbled Larissa.</p>
<p>Daniel took her hand and they crouched together. Following the shocks, the building started to sway violently.</p>
<p>"Ouch!"</p>
<p>A scream came through the sliding partition with a bump.</p>
<p>"Mu, mu, mu..." Daniel tried to speak her but couldn't.</p>
<p>"Daniel and Larissa, are you OK?" Mother shouted.</p>
<p>But they couldn't reply. Then a standard lamp in the corner of their room fell down, followed by the room phone. Next a thermos toppled down onto the floor.</p>
<p>"W, we have to get out of here," moaned Daniel in a hoarse voice.</p>
<p>"How?" Larissa asked, "Which floor are we on?"</p>
<p>"Ah, the seventh.</p>
<p>Daniel tried to stand but couldn't. The sway was getting more violent.</p>
<p>"Mummy, help!" Larissa shouted at last.</p>
<p>But her reply didn't come soon.</p>
<p>"Are you OK, Mum?" asked Daniel.</p>
<p>"I'm OK, but something hit me."</p>
<p>"Are you hurt?"</p>
<p>"Oh, a little bit...there's some blood."</p>
<p>"Blood!"</p>
<p>The sway was getting calmer. They waited for the earthquake to finish. At last the tremor stopped. The two children went to their mother right away. She was lying on the floor.</p>
<p>"Mummy!" Larissa cried out, "Are you OK?"</p>
<p>She had her hand over her calf and blood was flowing out through her fingers. The chandelier had fallen and its fragments had spread everywhere.</p>
<p>"I was lucky that it didn't hit me directly."</p>
<p>Daniel said, "I'll get the first-aid case."</p>
<p>"There's ointment in my bag, Daniel, and Band-Aids, too."</p>
<p>"Where's your bag?"</p>
<p>"On the sofa." She pointed.</p>
<p>He walked to the sofa taking care not to tread on the glass.</p>
<p>"No, it's not...oh, I found it."</p>
<p>It was half under the sofa. He grabbed it up and tried to open it.</p>
<p>"Bring it to me." Mother told him, sitting up.</p>
<p>"Are you in pain, Mum?" He handed her the bag.</p>
<p>The wound wasn't deep. She applied the medicine to the wound and stuck a Band-Aid on it. She tried to stand up, and then big knocks sounded at the door.</p>
<p>"Is someone there?"</p>
<p>Mother answered, "Yes!"</p>
<p>"Open the door."</p>
<p>Daniel dashed to the door and turned the handle. But it wouldn't open.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?" the voice asked.</p>
<p>"I've unlocked it but..."</p>
<p>"OK, step aside. I'll kick it."</p>
<p>The next moment the door opened with a crash.</p>
<p>"Are you all OK? I'm from the next room."</p>
<p>"My mother is hurt."</p>
<p>"It's not serious," she said, walking to the door, "Thank you very much. We'll be OK for the moment."</p>
<p>"That's good. Take care. I'll check the other rooms."</p>
<p>He went away. Daniel and Mother turned around, Larissa cried silently.</p>
<p>"It's OK," Mother said, "It's OK."</p>
<p>"Taro said to leave."</p>
<p>Mother hugged her and said, "I told you nobody knows where an earthquake is going to happen."</p>
<p>"Why did he say that? Why?" she continued crying.</p>
<p>"Sorry, Mum," Daniel said, "We completely believed him."</p>
<p>"No, he can't have told a lie," Larissa denied Daniel's remark, "but, but..."</p>
<p>She looked as if she couldn't accept what had just happened. And her weeping didn't seem to stop soon.</p>

<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>The Calamity</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>Thirty minutes later that two staff of the hotel came to the seventh floor. They gathered all the guests in the hallway.</p>
<p>"Please declare if you are hurt and if you have persons hurt in your room. We can treat slightly wounded guests. For seriously wounded guests, we have requested ambulances, but as there are probably a lot of injured people in this town, we can't expect them to come soon. So we'll give first-aid and after that you have to wait."</p>
<p>One of guests asked, "TV's not working. We don't know the situation around here. We want to watch news."</p>
<p>"The TV system will be up and running soon. Our staff are working on it now. For now you can't use the room phones. As for mobile phones, you may or may not be able to get through. We're afraid it's going to take some time before things return to normal."</p>
<p>Another guest said, "The chandelier in my room fell down and the balcony door glass is cracked."</p>
<p>"I see. Please write on this form your room number and the damaged things you urgently want mended and anything else you want help with. But we can't respond to all of your requests soon. Well, please line here"</p>
<p>After Mother filled in the form the three returned to their room. They tidied up things as much as they could.</p>
<p>About thirty minutes later Daniel said, "I can hear the TV from the next room."</p>
<p>„ÄÄMother said, "Switch ours on."</p>
<p>".......There's no signal from the head station in Tokyo. We are unable to report the situations there. We are afraid that the building may have collapsed. We are now coming to you from Sendai. We will try to keep you informed as much as possible.</p>
<p>This morning a major earthquake occurred at eight twenty one. It was felt over half the area of Japan. Its epicentre was in Tokyo. We don't know the extent of the damage. From what we guess Tokyo has been destroyed. And from some of the calls we have received, there are lot of victims of the earthquake and many fires burning in Tokyo and the surrounding areas. It is feared that there will be some aftershocks. Use maximum caution, please. It appears that the government, the meteorological agency and other agencies are not functioning. The„ÄÄinformation we have is from our branch offices. Just in - news of a tsunami......."</p>
<p>Daniel and his mother turned pale. Neither of them could find words to say. Then Larissa moaned, "We have to call Daddy."</p>
<p>Mother suddenly came to herself, "Oh, that's right, Larissa. But I wonder if we can get through now."</p>
<p>"But we have to try," said Daniel, "Dad must be worried about us because he would have felt the earthquake in Sapporo."</p>
<p>Mother took her mobile phone out of her bag and made the call.</p>
<p>"I can't get through. There must be too many on the line." She said and hung up.</p>
<p>"Pass it to me, mum. I'll try in ten minutes," said Daniel.</p>
<p>"OK, kids," Mother said as she gave him the phone, "You were both right. We were all saved through Taro's warning."</p>
<p>"I told you!" Larissa shouted, "Taro is not the kind to lie."</p>
<p>"Sorry, Larissa. The earthquake was strong here, so I can't imagine how strong it must have been in Tokyo."</p>
<p>"Mum, I wonder if," Daniel said, "our house has collapsed."</p>
<p>"So do I. But right now we should be happy that we are alive."</p>
<p>"Yeah...but what if we can't go back home?"</p>
<p>"Ah, I don't know. We'll just have to see how things turn out."</p>
<p>*„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ *</p>
<p>It was four o'clock the next morning when Daniel received a call from his father.</p>
<p>"Mum, it's Dad." Daniel woke her in a small voice as Larissa was sleeping.</p>
<p>"What? ...ah, the phone, the PHONE!" Mother jumped out of bed. "From Dad?"</p>
<p>"Yes." Daniel passed her the phone.</p>
<p>Mother started to talk like a machine gun. Daniel was surprised at her manner. He realized that she had been uneasy, too."</p>
<p>Larissa woke up, "What happened?"</p>
<p>"Dad's on the phone."</p>
<p>"Daddy? Yes! I wanna talk to him."</p>
<p>"You have to wait. They are talking about important things now."</p>
<p>"Why did Daddy call us at this hour?"</p>
<p>"He could finally get through to us, I guess. The line is less busy in the early morning."</p>
<p>"Oh, I see. Everyone should be asleep now."</p>
<p>The two waited for their mother to finish talking. But it was too long for Larissa to wait, and she began to yawn. By the time Mother finished the call, Larissa had already fallen asleep.</p>
<p>"Larissa," Mother said, "Oh, she's asleep."</p>
<p>"You don't need to wake her," Daniel said.</p>
<p>"Here you speak to Dad then."</p>
<p>"Dad! It's me! ... Oh, it's gone dead." He turned to Mother, "What did Dad say?"</p>
<p>"Dad said he will come over from Sapporo, and we have to pick him up at the air port."</p>
<p>"Which airport?"</p>
<p>"I don't know yet because he hasn't made a reservation. He'll do that this morning and let us know. In the meantime we have to go to the nearest airport and wait for him to contact us."</p>
<p>"Umm, the airports around here are Hanamaki and Sendai. Which one should we go to?"</p>
<p>"They are both the same distance from here, but it should be easier for Dad to get a ticket to Hanamaki because the airport isn't as busy as Sendai."</p>
<p>"I see, but I thought we were going to go to Dad."</p>
<p>"It's a pretty long way by car. So Dad said he would come to us. Anyway we have to go to bed now. It will soon be dawn."</p>
<p>"OK, good night."</p>
<p>"Good night, Daniel."</p>
<p>*„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ*</p>
<p>No sooner had she woken up than Larissa began to say, "I wanted to talk to Daddy. Why didn't you pass me the phone?"</p>
<p>"You had already fallen asleep," Mother told.</p>
<p>"But I had a lot of things to tell Daddy."</p>
<p>"Stop whining," Daniel scolded, "You'll be able to meet Dad today."</p>
<p>"Oh, really?"</p>
<p>"We have to go to the airport soon."</p>
<p>"But I wanna have breakfast and brush my teeth and ‚Äï."</p>
<p>"Hurry up!"</p>
<p>*„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ*</p>
<p>The three were on their way to Hanamaki airport.</p>
<p>Daniel asked Mother, "How did things turn out that Dad was able to come so soon? Did he get all his work done?"</p>
<p>"He tried to reach his firm in Tokyo but he couldn't. So he had to postpone what he was doing."</p>
<p>They kept quiet for a while, and then Mother muttered.</p>
<p>"Our life had been going along well, but we will have trials from now on‚Äï."</p>
<p>"STOP, MUMMY!" suddenly Larissa shouted.</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" Mother asked.</p>
<p>"Another earthquake!"</p>
<p>"Again?" Mother slowed down, "How do you know that?"</p>
<p>"I saw it. Stop the car now!"</p>
<p>Daniel said, "Mum, it must be true. If an earthquake breaks out, other cars may hit ours."</p>
<p>"Now! Stop now!" Larissa cried.</p>
<p>"All right," Mother said as she stopped the car, "let's get out."</p>
<p>She put on the hazard lights and said, "Now it's clear."</p>
<p>The three ran out of the car and lay down on the bank along the highway. The earthquake came soon. The ground started to sway heavily. It seemed bigger than the last one.</p>
<p>"Mummy!" Larissa asked for help.</p>
<p>Mother took her hand. Then they heard a big bang like a crash. The three lay flat. Daniel raised his head to see what happened.</p>
<p>"Oh, my God!"</p>
<p>"What's up?"</p>
<p>"Our car has been hit!"</p>
<p>When Daniel looked back to his mother, another bang occurred.</p>
<p>"Oh, God," said Mother to herself.</p>
<p>The mobile phone rang just as the earthquake was dying down. Mother sat up and answered the phone.</p>
<p>"Darling, we don't know when we can meet you at the airport! Someone smashed into the car! What ? You can't come? Why not?"</p>
<p>The two children looked up their mother.</p>
<p>"Oh, my God!" Larissa said this time.</p>
<p>"Don't imitate me!" Daniel told her.</p>
<p>"I wasn't. I hate you!"</p>
<p>Then ground swayed again.</p>
<p>"An aftershock?" Daniel said.</p>
<p>Larissa's face went rigid with fear.</p>
<p>"Daniel!" she reached for him. He grasped her hand. Mother was still talking to her husband as she crouched. The children stared at Mother with anxiety. Then Larissa looked at something.</p>
<p>"I wonder if that was Taro."</p>
<p>"What?" Daniel asked.</p>
<p>"Just now something round flew over there. I wanna ask him the situation in..."</p>
<p>Suddenly her body hardened like a bronze statue.</p>
<p>"What's up, Larissa?" Daniel asked surprisingly, but she didn't answer. "Mum! Larissa is acting peculiar!"</p>
<p>But Mother just glanced at her and continued talking. The swaying calmed down gradually.</p>
<p>Daniel asked again, "Are you OK?"</p>
<p>She didn't stir at all. But after a while her expression returned to usual and she suddenly cried out.</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" Mother at last paid attention.</p>
<p>"I haven't done anything." Daniel replied.</p>
<p>Larissa began saying, "Many people have died, and many more people are dying, buildings and houses are broken, and ... and."</p>
<p>"OK, Larissa," Mother nestled her in her arms, "You can see them. I understand. It's all right ... it's all right."</p>
<p>Daniel asked Mother, "What did Dad say?"</p>
<p>"He can't come because Hanamaki and Sendai airports are closed."</p>
<p>"Why are they closed?"</p>
<p>"They found some rifts in the runways."</p>
<p>"I thought something like that may happen."</p>
<p>Mother went on, "And he said Tokyo has been destroyed."</p>
<p>"Oh, God!"</p>
<p>"I saw that," Larissa said as she sobbed, "Many fires had broken out after the big earthquake, and a huge tsunami came over Tokyo."</p>
<p>"It's worse than I expected," Daniel said, "What shall we do, Mum?"</p>
<p>"Dad said Sapporo isn't too bad. It's better we go to him."</p>
<p>"But how?"</p>
<p>"We'll go to Sendai and take the ferry."</p>
<p>Larissa asked, "Sapporo is in Hokkaido?"</p>
<p>"That's right. We have to get to a port town over there."</p>
<p>Daniel asked, "And then we'll leave for Sapporo?"</p>
<p>"If things go well."</p>
<p>"How will we get to Sendai?"</p>
<p>"We have to check the car first."</p>
<p>They went back onto the highway and were surprised at what they saw. Some cars had hit one another, others had ended up into the bushes along the highway. A few of them were on fire. And there were many cracks were in the highway and the surface was warped.</p>
<p>"We must rescue the people in the cars!" Daniel said.</p>
<p>"Yes." Mother replied as she looked around.</p>
<p>Then Larissa started to run towards one of the cars, "She's bleeding!"</p>
<p>Mother and Daniel followed.</p>
<p>"Oh, terrible," Mother said, "We have to get her out of the car."</p>
<p>It seemed the car had hit another one. And the other one was flung into the bushes. The driver bled from the forehead and mouth. Mother tried to open the door, and luckily it opened.</p>
<p>"Are you OK?" she asked but the driver didn't answer. Mother thought she might be dead and tried to cover Larissa's eyes. Just then the driver moved.</p>
<p>"My baby," she murmured.</p>
<p>"Baby?" Mother looked at the passenger seat, but nobody was there. She stuck her head in and surveyed the back seat, but all she could see was a vacant child seat. A bad feeling came over her. She withdrew her head and swung open the back door.</p>
<p>"Don't look, kids!" she shut the door quickly.</p>
<p>"How's my baby?" the woman murmured again.</p>
<p>"I think ... I think that ..." Mother's voice was shaking.</p>
<p>"Oh, my God," said the woman with a hollow voice. Tears filled her eyes and flowed down her cheeks.</p>
<p>"Come on. You are all right," Mother told her, but she soon stopped breathing.</p>
<p>Mother shook her head. Larissa and Daniel turned pale. The next moment another car suddenly shot out fire from the bush nearby them.</p>
<p>"Let's get out of here!" Mother shouted as she lifted up Larissa.</p>
<p>They lay down again on the opposite bank of the highway. For a while they kept still without saying anything.</p>
<p>Then Larissa said, "Mummy, what will happen to us?"</p>
<p>Mother stared at her but she couldn't find anything to say.</p>
<p>Daniel said, "Nobody knows what is going to happen."</p>
<p>"Is that true, Mummy?"</p>
<p>"Ah ... Daddy probably knows."</p>
<p>"I wanna meet Da- ugh!"</p>
<p>Suddenly a big blast broke out. The three put their faces onto the grass. Fragments of glass fell down all around them. Mother covered Larissa with her body.</p>
<p>"Are you OK, Daniel?" Mother asked.</p>
<p>But Daniel couldn't answer due to fear.</p>
<p>"Are you OK?" she asked again after a moment.</p>
<p>"Maybe," answered Daniel as he brushed fragments of glass off his shoulders.</p>
<p>They got up carefully. A car in front of them was shooting fire.</p>
<p>"Mum, there's no way to drive to Sendai," Daniel said, "Even if our car works, it's impossible to drive on this highway."</p>
<p>"Yes ... but we must get to Dad somehow."</p>
<p>"We'll have to walk then."</p>
<p>A person passed by them. They stared at him.</p>
<p>"Are you going to hang around here?" he asked them.</p>
<p>"We haven't decided yet," replied Mother.</p>
<p>"You had better walk somewhere you can stay the night."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes."</p>
<p>Going away, he added, "You will never leave here if you keep rescuing."</p>
<p>Larissa said after he had gone, "Many people need help. Why did he say such a thing. Why won't he help and, and why won't -."</p>
<p>"OK, Larissa." Mother drew her close to her breast. "I know what you mean."</p>
<p>People started to walk along the highway. Some of them stopped to help the injured.</p>
<p>"I wonder if there are any houses around here," said Daniel.</p>
<p>"I guess they might be, although this highway bypasses the nearest town." Mother thought for a while and went on, "But maybe it's better we stick to the highway."</p>
<p>"OK, but ...," Daniel looked at Larissa, "She won't agree with us."</p>
<p>Larissa's cheeks puffed out.</p>
<p>"From the look of her," said Mother, "it seems we have to resume rescuing injured people."</p>
<p>They went onto the highway again.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 5</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>The Chaos</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>Larissa, Daniel, and their mother stayed to rescue the injured. It was now dusk. No doctors or nurses had arrived. Some of the injured were getting weak. A few strangers had helped the three but all they could do was give first-aid. Here and there on the highway injured people lay in groups of three or four. Mother had begun to feel as if they were on a battlefield.</p>
<p>"Mummy, I'm hungry," Larissa said.</p>
<p>Mother and Daniel felt the same but they hadn't said anything because they knew they didn't have any food.</p>
<p>"Stay here. I'll be back soon," said Mother and left for somewhere.</p>
<p>"Daniel, I feel chilly."</p>
<p>"Me, too. There might be a blanket in the car."</p>
<p>Luckily there was one in the boot. Daniel brought it to Larissa. When he was about to cover her shoulders with it, one of the injured nearby murmured.</p>
<p>"I feel cold."</p>
<p>An old woman lying on the ground was shivering. Daniel gazed at Larissa.</p>
<p>"I don't need it," said Larissa, "I don't feel so cold."</p>
<p>Daniel covered the old woman with it and asked, "Are you OK?"</p>
<p>"Thank you, my children. After a while she asked, "When is your birthday?"</p>
<p>"My birthday? Ah, it's May sixth."</p>
<p>"And your sister's?"</p>
<p>Larissa answered, "My birthday is on May tenth."</p>
<p>"I'd like to send you birthday cards if it's OK with you."</p>
<p>"Of course, thank you," said Daniel.</p>
<p>"Of course, thank you," repeated Larissa.</p>
<p>Daniel stared at Larissa.</p>
<p>Larissa said, "I just said it with all my heart. I didn't mean to repeat you."</p>
<p>"You are always repeating -."</p>
<p>"Please," the old woman broke in, "don't quarrel over me."</p>
<p>The children looked at her.</p>
<p>"Sorry, I didn't intend to worry you," Daniel said.</p>
<p>"No, no problem."</p>
<p>The two fell into silence. They watched for a while as strangers passed by. One of the strangers came up to the children.</p>
<p>"Hi, a boy and a girl. Just the two of you?"</p>
<p>Daniel looked at him. He had a big rucksack and mountain-climbing boots. He looked in his early thirties.</p>
<p>"Ah, our mother went somewhere just now," Daniel answered.</p>
<p>The stranger shot a glance at the old woman. "Your grandmother?"</p>
<p>"No, but ... ah..."</p>
<p>Larissa cut in, "She is our friend."</p>
<p>"Oh ... you are taking care of her." He sat down and deposited his rucksack on the ground. "I'm tired. Is it OK to join you? It's dangerous at night."</p>
<p>"Yes," they both at once.</p>
<p>He started to open the rucksack. The children gazed at his movements.</p>
<p>"You must be hungry." He looked at the two as if to make sure.</p>
<p>"Yes, a little," Daniel replied with restraint.</p>
<p>Then Mother came back. She had a small paper bag.</p>
<p>"Someone gave me some biscuits." She said and looked at the guy.</p>
<p>He looked back and said, "You all look hungry." He fumbled in his rucksack.</p>
<p>"We have been rescuing the injured till now," Mother said, "So we haven't had a meal, not that we had anything to eat."</p>
<p>"Don't worry. I have some food. I was on my way to the mountains, when the earthquake struck. And I decided to go back to Sendai but on the way I helped the people rescuing the injured."</p>
<p>He took something out and went on, "It's dangerous to move at night especially for children. On the way I heard from strangers that Sendai is just rubble and almost all of the towns around here have been flattened. And that all of companies have shut down, stores are closed and public offices aren't functioning."</p>
<p>He laid out some rice balls and tins of fish in front of him.</p>
<p>"On the way I saw many people helping one another, but some people had started to do bad things. People will be fighting for food soon. Anyway we have food now. Let's have a meal."</p>
<p>He held out a rice ball to Larissa. "Go ahead, take it."</p>
<p>"Thank you ... Ah, I don't know your name."</p>
<p>"Oh, sorry, my child. Please call me Momotaro."</p>
<p>"What? Is that really your name?"</p>
<p>"No, but in these circumstances it's a pretty good one. There's no similar name, and you won't forget it."</p>
<p>"No, I won't. Thank you, Momotaro."</p>
<p>"You're welcome. And -."</p>
<p>"And I'm Larissa."</p>
<p>"Oh, Larissa. Is that Japanese?"</p>
<p>"No. My father is English."</p>
<p>He gave rice balls to Daniel and Mother. They said thanks and introduced themselves, too.</p>
<p>He opened the tins and said, "It's a pity this is all I have."</p>
<p>"No, no problem," Mother said and she quickly divided her rice ball in tow and held out half to the old woman.</p>
<p>"You are good-hearted, I know, but I don't intend to accept it. You have two children. When you are hungry, you can't guard them."</p>
<p>"No, you have to eat it. You will get weak unless you eat."</p>
<p>"Either way I'll go to heaven by dawn. I also have a fever and it'll be cold tonight. Thank you so much but I won't accept it."</p>
<p>The old woman rolled over on to her other side.</p>
<p>"Oh, God," said Mother. Tears formed in her eyes.</p>
<p>"It's all right," Momotaro said to Mother, "You eat it. That's her wish."</p>
<p>He pointed to the fish. "Don't be shy."</p>
<p>They kept quiet as they ate. Then Momotaro said, "The battle has already started for survival. Not only this place is damaged. Maybe all of Japan. No one's coming to help. No doctors, nurses, volunteers or rescue parties."</p>
<p>"Where are you heading to?" Mother asked.</p>
<p>"To Sendai ... my fiance ought to be there, although I don't know whether she is at her company or at home."</p>
<p>"Have you tried to call her?" asked Larissa.</p>
<p>"Of course, many times. But I haven't been able to get through."</p>
<p>Nobody said anything more because they knew how hard it was to get through to Father.</p>
<p>It was getting dark.</p>
<p>After the meal Momotaro said, "We have to secure the place for sleeping."</p>
<p>They looked around. Near by them the old woman lay, a little distance away three people lay and on the opposite side of the highway two people lay. Their„ÄÄcar rested diagonally on the edge of the highway.</p>
<p>"I have a sleeping bag, but ... do you have something like a blanket?" he asked.</p>
<p>Then the old woman said, "Sorry, I'm using their blanket."</p>
<p>"No, no problem," Mother said, "We have some spare clothes."</p>
<p>Momotaro said to Mother, "The road is hard. It's better to sleep on the bank, even though it slopes."</p>
<p>It was a little past eight o'clock. The three and Momotaro lay on the bank. Then Momotaro's mobile phone suddenly rang. He sprang to his feet and took the phone out of his breast pocket.</p>
<p>"Hello! ... Sorry, I can't hear you.... What! Is that you, Yayoi?"</p>
<p>The three stared at him fixedly.</p>
<p>"Where are you? ... Pardon? ...... Oh, my God!"</p>
<p>He started to roll up his sleeping bag.</p>
<p>"I'll come soon. Hold on....yes, you can! ... What? ..."</p>
<p>He lowered the phone and looked at it with dejection.</p>
<p>"The phone died on me."</p>
<p>"Your fiance?" Mother asked falteringly.</p>
<p>"Yes. She's trapped under the debris of a building."</p>
<p>"Oh, that's terrible!"</p>
<p>"I must go now."</p>
<p>Then Larissa abruptly said, "She is saying something to you, Momotaro. Er ... thank you and good-bye?" Then she suddenly cried, "No! She's dying!"</p>
<p>"What?" Momotaro asked.</p>
<p>"I can see her legs. They are under a big rock. She can't move ... and, and blood is streaming from her head."</p>
<p>Mother quickly pulled her to her breast and said, "Sorry, she is drowsy."</p>
<p>"But," Momotaro replied, "Maybe she is clairvoyant," tears sprang to his eyes, "She couldn't make that up."</p>
<p>Daniel said, "Larissa sometimes sees things, but she's not always correct."</p>
<p>"OK, Daniel. But I'm going anyway."</p>
<p>He pushed the sleeping bag into his rucksack and shouldered it.</p>
<p>"Nice meeting you all."</p>
<p>He started to run. The three watched him in dismay, and Daniel shouted,</p>
<p>"Thank you Momotaro!"</p>
<p>He looked back, "You are welcome."</p>
<p>Mother and Larissa shouted, "Take care!"</p>
<p>But his figure had already faded out. The three for a while gazed at the darkness he had vanished into. And then mother said,</p>
<p>"Sorry, Larissa. I believed you but I thought he -."</p>
<p>"You wanted to avoid hurting him. I know you, mummy."</p>
<p>"He needs to find out what happened for himself."</p>
<p>Then people around them began to buzz. Mother went to the next group a little distance away. The children followed her.</p>
<p>Someone asked, "Really? Mount Fuji erupted?"</p>
<p>"Must have. Ash fell in the southern area of Fukushima prefecture."</p>
<p>Some people sighed.</p>
<p>"And it seems that people in Tokyo have started to move to the outskirts of the city. And with that the chaos has multiplied."</p>
<p>Another person asked, "Have about Sendai? Have you heard anything?"</p>
<p>"Apparently, Sendai is not as bad as Tokyo.</p>
<p>A man said, "It's the end."</p>
<p>The three plodded back to their place, when the old woman opened her eyes.</p>
<p>Daniel said, "Are you OK?"</p>
<p>"Ah, I have things I'd like to tell you all."</p>
<p>"OK," Mother said, "Tell us anything you like."</p>
<p>"Maybe my pelvis is broken. I'll be going soon. thank you very much for all your kindness."</p>
<p>"No, not at all," Mother replied.</p>
<p>"Mummy, please, save her," Larissa said, "Why don't the gods save her?"</p>
<p>The old woman said, "Ah, Larissa, they are busy now, because there are many injured, you know."</p>
<p>Daniel said, "I'm not sure there are gods. If there were, we have been saved already."</p>
<p>"Children, please listen to me. I'm not unfortunate. I know there are reasons in all things. So my death has a reason, too. There are no accidents in the world. Don't grieve for me. I accept my fate."</p>
<p>The three couldn't come up with any words.</p>
<p>She went on, "I'm sorry, children, I won't be able to send you birthday cards."</p>
<p>"No, no problem," Larissa said, "If you can't send us any, I'll send you one.</p>
<p>Daniel looked at Larissa, "How will you-."</p>
<p>The old woman cut in, "Sorry, Daniel," and she replied to Larissa, "You can send me one in Heaven"</p>
<p>"Yes. And my friend will deliver it to you."</p>
<p>"Uh, what is your friend like?"</p>
<p>"He lives in outer space, and he can go anywhere freely."</p>
<p>"Oh, that's good. My birthday is the eighth of April. I'm looking forward to receiving your card."</p>
<p>"That is the same date," Daniel said, "as Buddha was born on."</p>
<p>"Yes. I'll soon see Buddha. Sorry, but I'm a little tired."</p>
<p>"OK," Daniel replied.</p>
<p>She closed her eyes and didn't open them again.</p>

<p>CHAPTER Ôºñ</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>The Aid</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>The situation looked like getting worse. No rescue parties, no food, no cars through the highway, and so the injured died after another. There was no chance of surviving there.</p>
<p>Midnight came. Daniel dozed on the grass of the bank.</p>
<p>"I wanna go for a pee, Daniel," Larissa appealed.</p>
<p>"Go with Mum."</p>
<p>"She is sleeping."</p>
<p>"I'm sleeping, too."</p>
<p>"No. You are awake. Please come with me. Quick!"</p>
<p>Daniel stood up reluctantly and took her hand. They walked down the embankment and looked around.</p>
<p>"That place is good. Go over there," Daniel told.</p>
<p>Larissa squatted and said and said, "Don't leave me, Daniel."</p>
<p>"Don't squeal. I won't."</p>
<p>It was dark, but the moonlight faintly illuminated around them.</p>
<p>"Finished?"</p>
<p>"Yeah," Larissa came to him and held out her hand.</p>
<p>Then the bushes at the back of them rustled. Daniel quickly took her hand and started to run.</p>
<p>"Hi," a low voice said, "It's me."</p>
<p>The two stopped and looked back.</p>
<p>"Taro?" asked Larissa.</p>
<p>"Yes. Have you forgotten me?"</p>
<p>"No, I've been expecting you."</p>
<p>"It's good that you are all safe."</p>
<p>"Why didn't you come to us earlier?"</p>
<p>"Ah, I had to talk to Atoa about many things."</p>
<p>"Oh, to your mother, no, I mean your friend."</p>
<p>Daniel asked, "What did you have to talk about?"</p>
<p>"Getting permission."</p>
<p>"Permission?" Larissa asked, "For what?"</p>
<p>"I wanted to shelter your family but wasn't allowed."</p>
<p>"What a pity!"</p>
<p>"But I was allowed to take you three to your father."</p>
<p>"Yes!"</p>
<p>Then they heard a call.</p>
<p>"Larissa!"</p>
<p>They looked at one another.</p>
<p>"Daniel!"</p>
<p>"Mummy's calling us," Larissa said, "What shall we do?"</p>
<p>Taro said to Daniel, "Would you introduce me to your mother?"</p>
<p>"Of course, but is that OK?"</p>
<p>"No problem. I'm ready."</p>
<p>Daniel shouted, "We are over here, Mum."</p>
<p>"What are you doing?"</p>
<p>"Larissa had to pee. Will you come here?"</p>
<p>"OK, but I can't see you."</p>
<p>Then Taro's body started to shine faintly."</p>
<p>"Is that you? What's that glowing."</p>
<p>When Mother reached them, she was taken aback."</p>
<p>"This is Taro„ÄÄ?„ÄÄour friend, we said before," Daniel introduced him.</p>
<p>"Uh, OK, I've heard about you. Nice to meet you."</p>
<p>"The same to you," Taro replied, "Please don't be alarmed. I can make my body shine in the dark."</p>
<p>"But," Larissa asked, "how do you do that?"</p>
<p>"It's easy. Everyone has a clear light in their heart. And if you realize that, you can glow, too."</p>
<p>"How do I realize that -."</p>
<p>"Stop it," Daniel cut in, "We have things we must tell Mum."</p>
<p>"Oh, I forgot."</p>
<p>Daniel explained to Mother what Taro had said. She looked dubious.</p>
<p>"How are you going to take us to Sapporo?"</p>
<p>"You can go there through a tunnel."</p>
<p>"Where is the tunnel?"</p>
<p>Larissa cut in, "I passed through one when I went to London."</p>
<p>"London? So ... that was you, who struck Sophie?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I've done it!" Larissa held her mouth with her hand.</p>
<p>"Sorry," Taro said to Mother, "I asked Larissa to come to help save Sophia and her parents, although I'm basically forbidden to interfere in any events on the earth."</p>
<p>His mention of London embarrassed Mother. She didn't think he'd made up the story, but it was too soon for her to accept that it was true.</p>
<p>Daniel asked, "So where's the tunnel? Have you made it yet?"</p>
<p>"Yes. It's over there," Taro answered, "You have to bring your luggage."</p>
<p>"Now?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"OK. Come on guys. Let's get a move on."</p>
<p>The three tried to go up the bank, when Taro told them, "Keep a low profile."</p>
<p>"OK," Daniel replied.</p>
<p>After a while they came back. Taro led them to the tunnel.</p>
<p>"I can't go with you," Taro said, "The first to go is Larissa. You have done it before. OK?"</p>
<p>"Yes." Larissa entered the tunnel and then they heard her ask, "Where am I?"</p>
<p>"Wait a moment," Taro replied and said to Daniel, "You're next."</p>
<p>"OK." Daniel entered.</p>
<p>"Are you all right to go?" Taro asked Mother.</p>
<p>"Yes, but we've never been to Sapporo. Would you tell me where the exit is?"</p>
<p>"I can't tell you exactly, but it's somewhere in the middle of town."</p>
<p>"I see. Thank you very much, Taro."</p>
<p>"You are welcome."</p>
<p>Mother entered the tunnel.</p>
<p>„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ *„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ *</p>
<p>The exit was the booth of a public toilet.</p>
<p>"How cramped!" shouted Larissa, "Your bag is sticking into me!"</p>
<p>"Don't be so close! Daniel shouted back, "Mum will be here soon. Open the door."</p>
<p>"How?"</p>
<p>"Turn that," he told, "right side of you."</p>
<p>Larissa turned the latch, just as Mother arrived. The three were spilt out of the booth and toppled down with their luggage onto the floor.</p>
<p>"OUCH!" they uttered all at once.</p>
<p>Then a stranger hailed them, "Are you OK?"</p>
<p>The three were surprised to see her.</p>
<p>"Oh, no problem. Thanks," said Mother.</p>
<p>They ran out of the toilet. The stranger chuckled as they hastily departed.</p>
<p>"Why was it the ladies toilet?" Daniel voiced his complaint.</p>
<p>But the other two weren't listening. They were wondering where they were.</p>
<p>"A television tower!" Larissa pointed to a shining tower that soared in the dark sky.</p>
<p>"I've got it," Mother said, "We are in Odori-Park."</p>
<p>"I see," Daniel replied, "This is the square where the Sapporo snow festival takes place every winter. It's famous."</p>
<p>"That's right. I have to call your Father."</p>
<p>She took out her phone. Daniel and Larissa started to chatter as they watched the strange town while Mother talked.</p>
<p>"This city looks like Tokyo. A lot of cars run in the streets and many people walk around at night," Daniel said.</p>
<p>"But there was no earthquake here."</p>
<p>"We'll be able to get food here."</p>
<p>"That's good," Larissa said. And then she suddenly pointed the moon and shouted, "Daniel, look!"</p>
<p>"Wow, what a colour! I've never seen such a red moon before."</p>
<p>"Me neither ... must be a sign."</p>
<p>Then Mother called them, "Daniel and Larissa. Let's walk to the other side."</p>
<p>"Why?" Larissa asked, "How's Daddy?"</p>
<p>"He'll come here soon by taxi. The roads around here are one-way."</p>
<p>"OK. I see."</p>
<p>Under the weight of their belongings, the three waddled to the other side of the park. In no time Father came.</p>
<p>"Daddy! Daddy!" Larissa shouted before Father got out of the taxi. Their six eyes shone with excitement. Father paid the driver, then held Larissa close.</p>
<p>"I've wanted to see you so much, Daddy," tears flowed out of her eyes.</p>
<p>"Me, too. All right, all right, Larissa." He embraced her.</p>
<p>Then Daniel stood close to him. Father also embraced him silently. Daniel was moved to tears.</p>
<p>"All right, Daniel. You've had a tough time, I know."</p>
<p>Then someone suddenly called them, "What are you doing."</p>
<p>They all looked back.</p>
<p>"Us?" Father asked.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>The man in navy blue clothes was a constable.</p>
<p>"I've just met my family again."</p>
<p>"Just now?"</p>
<p>"Er, we had many difficulties, because they were in Tokyo."</p>
<p>"In Tokyo! Oh, I guess that was terrible. All your family are safe?"</p>
<p>"Yes, fortunately we are all safe."</p>
<p>"That's good. Anyway it's dangerous around here at night."</p>
<p>"We just came here to meet. We'll leave for our hotel now."</p>
<p>"OK. Take care."</p>
<p>"Thanks."</p>
<p>"Not at all."</p>
<p>Larissa said to the constable, "Good night, sir."</p>
<p>"Good night, sweetie."</p>
<p>„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ*„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ*</p>
<p>They bought some food at a convenience store and took a taxi to the hotel. At the information desk Father asked to have his room changed to a bigger one. In their room, they could relax at last.</p>
<p>"Oh, there are beds," Larissa shouted and jumped on the nearest one.</p>
<p>Mother took a shower first. In the meantime Daniel and Larissa spoke to Father about the many experiences they'd had. They took a shower after Mother. Then they all had supper.</p>
<p>Daniel and Larissa had more things they wanted to say to Father, but after supper they became sleepy sharply. They didn't want to sleep but the moment they lay on their beds they fell asleep.</p>
<p>Mother and Father talked about various things until dawn.</p>
<p>„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ*„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ*</p>
<p>Father presented a proposal he had to the children over breakfast at the restaurant in the hotel.</p>
<p>"My old friend has a second house in Shimamaki ? actually his wife has. Her parents lived there for a long time. She herself grew up there. But her father died the year before last and her mother died last year. So the house is empty now. And they said that we could stay there."</p>
<p>Daniel looked at Larissa dumbly.</p>
<p>Larissa looked back at him and asked Father, "Is it a long way away?"</p>
<p>"No ... but it's a little bit far."</p>
<p>Mother said, "It costs a lot of money to stay at a hotel. We are lucky to get this offer."</p>
<p>Father went on, "While you all were having difficulties I was searching for somewhere to live. And only yesterday my friend gave me the good news."</p>
<p>"I think we are lucky, too," Daniel said, "It's no problem for me as long as we are together."</p>
<p>"How about you, Larissa?" asked Mother.</p>
<p>"I think we are lucky, too. It's no problem for me -."</p>
<p>"Don't mimic me," told Daniel.</p>
<p>"I didn't!"</p>
<p>"OK, calm down," Father said, "We all agree, then. Now we have to get a car as there're no shops near the house."</p>
<p>"Yes!" Daniel gave a shout of joy.</p>
<p>"But," Mother cautioned, "It'll be a used car."</p>
<p>"What a pity!" Daniel was disappointed.</p>
<p>"We have to economize from now on because we don't know what will happen to Daddy's company."</p>
<p>Daniel fell silent.</p>
<p>Then Larissa remembered their own house, "Daddy, what happened to our house?"</p>
<p>"According to the news, most of the houses in Tokyo have been destroyed or burnt down. And all of the infrastructure ? railway lines, roads, power transmission systems, etc ? has been destroyed."</p>
<p>"I see ... so how are the people in Tokyo?"</p>
<p>"Uh, many people died and the rest probably have no food and nowhere to go."</p>
<p>"We are really lucky, aren't we?"</p>
<p>"I think it's not just luck."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"We owe our luck to you. If you weren't a friend of Taro's, we wouldn't be safe now."</p>
<p>"Don't thank me, then. Thank Taro."</p>
<p>"OK, sweetie."</p>

<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>CHAPTER 7</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>The New House</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>They went to a used car dealer and bought a cheap car. But they couldn't take it away at the time because they had to get it registered. That took three days. In the meantime they went sightseeing around Sapporo. They visited the zoo, Mt. Moiwa, the botanical gardens and the aquarium in Otaru ? a neighbouring city. They really enjoyed those few days. And it almost seemed like they hadn't experienced the earthquakes.</p>
<p>Three days later they left for Shimamaki at last. Their car ran inland for two hours and ran along the coast for one hour. In the car Father told the children to be prepared for a shock because the house was very old. On their way they bought a vacuum cleaner and a small refrigerator. After that they dropped by a supermarket to get some food.</p>
<p>"Oh, this doesn't look so bad," Larissa said when they arrived at their new house.</p>
<p>She wasn't disappointed very much as she'd prepared for the worst, but Daniel looked disappointed. He kept quiet.</p>
<p>They carried the luggage into the house together and cleaned the rooms. In the house there were cupboards, a table, futons and every thing else they would need because Father's friend stayed there with his family every summer. The house had a large field, although it was low bush now. Nearby, a stream ran past the house to the sea a hundred meters away. The Route five highway ran between the house and the coast.</p>
<p>"Listen to me," Father told his family outside, "We can use this land around the house. I intend to start cultivating it tomorrow. So I want you all to join me. OK?"</p>
<p>"What are you going to plant, Daddy?" asked Larissa.</p>
<p>"It's a little too late to get a full harvest this year but some kinds of vegetables will grow now. This will be our insurance."</p>
<p>Daniel asked, "Does it mean that our stay might last for some time?"</p>
<p>"At the worst, yes."</p>
<p>"My God," said Daniel weakly.</p>
<p>"But before that, we must make a road through the field to the hill."</p>
<p>"Why?" asked Larissa.</p>
<p>"In the event of an earthquake we can go to that hill and we'll be safe from tsunamis."</p>
<p>"But," said Daniel, "we can go away to a mountain by car, can't we?"</p>
<p>"No. A tsunami will come soon after an earthquake, besides there are no roads from the highway to the hills near here."</p>
<p>"Oh, really."</p>
<p>Mother said to the three, "OK. It'll be hard work to cut the bush. You had better sleep well tonight."</p>
<p>She went into the house to cook dinner.</p>
<p>The sun was setting behind a far away mountain near the coast and a cold wind blew gently in from the sea. The other three went into the house, too.</p>
<p>„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ *„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ *„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ</p>
<p>The next morning the family members started their task, but Larissa didn't feel like doing that. She rambled about the field, watching insects, she also soaked her hands in a brook and looked up at the sky. But nobody complained as she was a child.</p>
<p>It came to lunchtime.</p>
<p>Larissa asked, "Daddy, why are desperate crimes increasing?</p>
<p>"Uh, that's difficult question ... but someone said that these days people are divided into two groups ? good people and bad people. It means good people become better and bad people become worse. So I think the worse people are committing crimes."</p>
<p>"I listened to a voice. It said when the end of the world comes, clear souls would be safe wherever they were and dirty souls wouldn't be safe anywhere they went."</p>
<p>Daniel was surprised. "The end of world!"</p>
<p>"Was it Taro's voice?" Mother asked.</p>
<p>"No. Actually it wasn't a voice. I understood the meaning by feeling."</p>
<p>"So who told you?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. But I didn't feel it had told me false things."</p>
<p>"Really the end of world will come?" Daniel asked.</p>
<p>„ÄÄThe three looked at Larissa.</p>
<p>"I didn't understand whether it will really come or not, but I felt we have to make our souls clear."</p>
<p>"How do we do that?" asked Daniel.</p>
<p>"We remove ... pride and arrogance from our hearts. And one more is that we do something for others except ... except ... I can't explain it."</p>
<p>"You mean," Father said, "except that we hold patronizing thoughts, don't you?"</p>
<p>"Probably so ... anyway it's important to do something for others with a pure mind."</p>
<p>"OK, Larissa. Whoever told you that, I'll try to do so from now on. I'm sure Mother and Daniel will, too."</p>
<p>During the afternoon Larissa helped to clear weeds away from the new lane. The whole family was covered in mud, but nobody complained. As they had all had hard experiences, work like this sat lightly on them. But the distance to the hill was further longer than they'd first thought. They couldn't tell when the task would be finished.</p>
<p>In the evening all of the family went to the beach. It was about a hundred metres from the house.</p>
<p>Father said, "I wonder if we can catch fish now."</p>
<p>Daniel replied, "I'd like to fish. Is there any fishing tackle in the house, Dad?"</p>
<p>"Probably not."</p>
<p>"Can we buy some?"</p>
<p>"As long as it's used."</p>
<p>"Used stuff?</p>
<p>"Yes. You saw how many people didn't have any food. Don't you think it is extravagant to buy new gear?"</p>
<p>"Er, OK, then."</p>
<p>„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ *„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ*„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ</p>
<p>In the end it took three days to make the lane. Meanwhile Father went to the nearest town to get some seedlings, fertiliser and used fishing tackle. Every day the TV broadcasted news about the situations of Japan and other countries that had experienced earthquakes. Larissa wanted to see Taro but she didn't tell that to her family because he hadn't brought good news recently.</p>
<p>It was on the seventh day after the family had come to the new house that Taro turned up for Larissa. That night she and her brother were upstairs earlier than usual. Their parents were still in the living room. Lying in their futons, the children heard a faint knock.</p>
<p>"It's Taro, maybe." Larissa sat up and told Daniel.</p>
<p>"Aren't you asleep yet?"</p>
<p>"Neither are you. Open the window, Daniel."</p>
<p>He stood up and opened the sliding window.</p>
<p>"Hi, I haven't seen you for quite a while." Taro„ÄÄgreeted.</p>
<p>"Oh, thank you so much, Taro." Daniel apologized, "We could get to Sapporo safely and could stay here because of you."</p>
<p>Larissa followed him, "Thank you, Taro. I -."</p>
<p>"Not at all," Taro cut her, "I have to help many people now."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" Daniel asked.</p>
<p>"The situation of the world has changed, and it's now my work."</p>
<p>"Your work?"</p>
<p>"I know you, Taro," Larissa cut in, "It has became your role. And ... anyway have you good or bad news today?"</p>
<p>"I'm afraid it's not good news."</p>
<p>"Uh...," her expression was indicative of her disappointment.</p>
<p>"OK," Daniel said, "I'm ready to listen."</p>
<p>"Er, from now on," Taro said, "all over the world many earthquakes and tsunamis will occur. Even at places where they have never happened before."</p>
<p>"Oh, God!" Daniel shouted with his low voice.</p>
<p>"But," Larissa said, "some earthquakes and tsunamis have occurred already, haven't they?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but they were no more than omens."</p>
<p>"What is the earth coming to?" Daniel said to himself.</p>
<p>"I don't know the details," Taro replied, "One thing I know clearly is that human beings will be divided into two types."</p>
<p>"I know," Larissa said, "Those who have clear souls and those who have dirty souls."</p>
<p>"How did you know that?" asked Taro.</p>
<p>"A sort of voice came to me."</p>
<p>"Um, it sounds like a high-grade spirit."</p>
<p>"But," Daniel said, "what if it was a demon?"</p>
<p>"No, a demon can't possess a clear soul. You know, she prophesied the earthquake in Sendai. You were able to escape from that."</p>
<p>"Yeah, that's true."</p>
<p>"I think she will continue to hear the voice from time to time."</p>
<p>"OK. Anyway don't you have anything else to tell us?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but ... it's heavy. There will be a fabulous global change."</p>
<p>"I think the world has changed enough."</p>
<p>"It's an enormous change that humankind has never experienced before."</p>
<p>"I can't imagine it."</p>
<p>"I can't give you specifics, but for example -."</p>
<p>Then Taro noticed Larissa looked odd. But he didn't say anything to her.</p>
<p>"She is viewing or listening to something," he told Daniel.</p>
<p>"Is she all right?"</p>
<p>"No problem. If a spirit from God has inhabited her, she will become wiser and more intelligent with each coming day."</p>
<p>"Unbelievable!"</p>
<p>"Besides that, she will have an unbreakable body."</p>
<p>"What! Are you for real?"</p>
<p>"I may have said too much."</p>
<p>"No, I didn't mean -."</p>
<p>At that moment Larissa came to herself and looked at the two boys.</p>
<p>"I've seen it," she said with tears in her eyes, "I've seen it!"</p>
<p>"Seen what?" asked Daniel.</p>
<p>"Many people will die ... and I saw violent earthquakes ... that were like ... the ground was reversed, and then huge tsunamis attacked every coast ... each one over a hundred metres high. I heard grievous cries for help."</p>
<p>"OK, Larissa." Taro approached the window and took her hands. "I saw it, too."</p>
<p>Suddenly Taro's body began to shine with white light and soon Larissa's body, too. Daniel looked at the two with his eyes wide open.</p>
<p>After a moment Taro said to Larissa, "You saw not only sorrowful scenes but also blessed ones, didn't you?"</p>
<p>"Uh, I remember the marvellous people who couldn't be burnt by fire, couldn't be buried into the ground by earthquakes and couldn't be swallowed by tsunamis."</p>
<p>"Yes, Larissa. Those were the people with clear souls, however there weren't many."</p>
<p>Daniel asked them, "Will this really happen?"</p>
<p>"I believe it will," answered Larissa.</p>
<p>"If it does, I won't survive."</p>
<p>"Why not?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Because I'm not sure about my soul. I have lied many times and have called my friends names and -."</p>
<p>"Uh, Daniel," Taro said, "You have time to change yourself."</p>
<p>"But ... I don't think I can."</p>
<p>"There is the will of universe. It wishes to save many. As many as possible."</p>
<p>"And what do I do?"</p>
<p>"You make your soul clear."</p>
<p>"How?"</p>
<p>"What you need to do is do things for others without self-conceit."</p>
<p>Larissa cut in, "What is self-conceit, Daniel?"</p>
<p>"It's when you do something, you only think of yourself ... kind of."</p>
<p>"Yes," Taro said, "When you do something for others, if you do that with self-conceit, it won't result in a good deed."</p>
<p>"I wonder if I can remove self-conceit," Daniel said.</p>
<p>"That's the most difficult thing for human beings to do."</p>
<p>Larissa asked Daniel, "Why don't you think you can do that? Why don't you believe in yourself?"</p>
<p>"But ..." Daniel was a little surprised at her.</p>
<p>Taro went on, "Uh, almost all quarrels, fights and wars are because of pride."</p>
<p>"OK. Do you know how to clean souls?"</p>
<p>"No, but ... you should keep in mind that the worst thing is denying, abusing or hurting others, and the best thing is doing something for others without them knowing."</p>
<p>"I remember," Larissa said suddenly, "we saved Sophie and her parents in London, but we never told them."</p>
<p>"That's right ...," Daniel said, "I see ... I see what you mean. Real love is probably like that."</p>
<p>Taro said, "You look like you understand but in order to realise truly, you must make it part of your life."</p>
<p>"OK, Taro."</p>
<p>"Anyway I'm afraid it's time to leave."</p>
<p>"All right. Will you come again?"</p>
<p>"I can't promise when, but I will."</p>
<p>Larissa said, "I'd like to see you soon."</p>
<p>"OK. Good night."</p>
<p>"Good night," Daniel and Larissa said at once.</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>CHAPTER 8</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>The Lull</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>The next morning„ÄÄDaniel and Larissa told their parents what they had talked with Taro about. The children didn't know whether their parents believed them, but from that day Father began going to bookstores to buy books about the environment, religion, legends and so on.</p>
<p>They finished planting all of the seedlings. After that they went fishing every day. Father wasn't able to go to work because almost of all his co-workers were dead or missing, including his boss. So his company no longer existed. Father said he had to look for a new occupation, and he sometimes made calls to acquaintances.</p>
<p>The family's life had been peaceful for some time. Mother said they had to catch fish, eat edible wild plants, and buy cheap food. Larissa didn't feel poor because this new life-style was enjoyable for her. Daniel was dissatisfied in the beginning but he changed his mind when he realised there were people much worse off.</p>
<p>"Good morning." One day an old woman visited their house. All of the family went to the front door. "I'm from next door. You've been here a while."</p>
<p>She had a few Japanese radishes in her hand. Her house was about two hundred metres from their's.</p>
<p>Mother said, "I'm sorry that I haven't been around to greet you."</p>
<p>"No problem. Where are you from?"</p>
<p>"From Tokyo."</p>
<p>"Oh, you must have had a tough time."</p>
<p>"Well, we narrowly escaped the earthquake. But we lost our house. And my husband's friend offered us this one.</p>
<p>"That's good. First time working on a land, then?"</p>
<p>"Yes, you could say that."</p>
<p>"OK. If you ever have any questions, just ask."</p>
<p>"You are too kind."</p>
<p>The old woman gave her the radishes and said, "These are from my field."</p>
<p>"Oh, they're huge! Thanks a lot."</p>
<p>Then Larissa asked, "Can I see your field sometime?"</p>
<p>"Come any time you like ? I live alone."</p>
<p>"Thank you. I'll."</p>
<p>"My husband left for heaven twenty years ago. And my daughters are married and live in Sapporo."</p>
<p>"Have you been alone since they left?" Mother asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, but it's no problem. My daughters sometimes visit me from Sapporo. Uh, won't you all come soon if you have time? You can dig in my field for potatoes."</p>
<p>"YES!" Larissa shouted and looked at Daniel.</p>
<p>"Let's go now," he replied.</p>
<p>They went to the old woman's house. She gave them all shovels and some bamboo baskets, and then led them to the fields behind her house.</p>
<p>"Dig here," the old woman said and she started digging by herself, "You see. You can get potatoes."</p>
<p>"Oh, so big and so many!" Larissa yelled and started digging.</p>
<p>All of them dug with delight.</p>
<p>"Daddy, Mummy, look! It's huge!" Larissa shouted over and over again.</p>
<p>"Daniel, how's it going?" Father asked.</p>
<p>But all he said was 'Uh'.</p>
<p>"He is totally absorbed in it," said Mother.</p>
<p>Daniel abruptly shouted, "Oh, I've cut a potato with my shovel!"</p>
<p>"You need to get your shovel in deeper," the old woman told him, "Look, like this."</p>
<p>"OK."</p>
<p>After a short while the old woman said, "I'll show you some special watermelons later."</p>
<p>Daniel replied, "Watermelons! I wanna see them now. Where are they?"</p>
<p>"Over there." She pointed to a spot lower down.</p>
<p>"I wanna see them, too." Larissa said.</p>
<p>"Come! Let's go!"</p>
<p>"So excited," Father said to Mother with a smile.</p>
<p>The old woman followed the children, and Father and Mother kept digging.</p>
<p>"One, two, three, four, five. That's huge!" Daniel said.</p>
<p>"I found one more!" Larissa said, "Oh, and another one!"</p>
<p>"Oh, seven watermelons in all." Daniel replied.</p>
<p>Then the old woman reached them. "You can take any one you like."</p>
<p>"This biggest one is good." Daniel tried to lift it. "Oh, it's too heavy."</p>
<p>It looked twice as big as Daniel's head.</p>
<p>"This small one is probably OK," Larissa said and tried to take it. "Oh, no. I can't. Daniel, help."</p>
<p>The old woman was watching them with smile. And at last she said, "You need someone to help you."</p>
<p>"Yes," Larissa replied, "I'll ask Daddy."</p>
<p>She started to run for Father.</p>
<p>At noon they came back to their house with many potatoes and a big watermelon. They had spaghetti and much potato salad. And they had the watermelon for dessert.</p>
<p>The days rolled by peacefully like that. It seemed they appreciated the lull after the disaster.</p>
<p>„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ *„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ*</p>
<p>It was the autumnal equinox. Trees made their leaves turn autumn colours and the colourful leaves drifted around the house. Daniel started going to school but Larissa couldn't go because there weren't any kindergartens near their house. So Father gave her lessons in Japanese, geography and the histories of Japan and the UK. She showed interest in the lessons and studied hard because the new knowledge gave her a new world view.</p>
<p>Daniel made friends with his classmates and sometimes brought them home. He didn't fight or quarrel any more, and he even intervened in his friend's fights and quarrels. He looked like he was sticking to what Taro had said.</p>
<p>Father repaired the house, worked in their field, went fishing and gave lessons to Larissa. In between he read many kinds of books. He sometimes told his wife what the books said.</p>
<p>Mother swept rooms, wiped the furniture, washed clothes, cooked meals and sometimes helped her husband to do things. But she never complained because she knew many people were worse off than her. She read books in bed at night that were recommended to her by her husband.</p>
<p>One day Larissa had a strange dream. She was in the house where she now lived, but there weren't any other family members. Although she didn't know the reason, she didn't feel lonely. It seemed like she was waiting for them to come home. And she felt so cosy, because all of the plants and all of the objects were shining with soft light, what's more, the ground and the sea were, too.</p>
<p>The next moment she was outside. It was raining hard but she didn't get wet. She wanted to be above the clouds and she felt she could go there. Suddenly her body started to suspend in the air and went above the clouds. She saw some people were suspended like her. All of their bodies were shining, too. They came up to her and greeted her with open arms. They said nothing, yet she knew they would always be with her. And she understood that they didn't think to do anything for themselves and always tried to do something for others. They all gave smiles to one another. They looked like they had peaceful minds. She felt the air was full of rejoicing.</p>
<p>Next morning Larissa told Daniel about her dream.</p>
<p>"You are a happy chap to have had such a dream in this situation. Many Japanese struggle just to live," said Daniel.</p>
<p>"No. This is a hint of ... of something."</p>
<p>"Of what?"</p>
<p>"I don't know but it must contain some important meaning."</p>
<p>Daniel could see she was serious, so he began to think seriously, too.</p>
<p>"Probably we all die, and just you survive."</p>
<p>"But I felt I was waiting for you all."</p>
<p>"Where were we, then?"</p>
<p>"I don't know."</p>
<p>"It's possible that just you died and went to heaven. So that's why everything was shining. We were still in this house. Don't you reckon?"</p>
<p>"No, I actually felt I was alive."</p>
<p>"Then, I give up."</p>
<p>After a few days Daniel told Father about Larissa's dream. Father brought out a thick book.</p>
<p>"There's something similar to Larissa's dream in this book."</p>
<p>"What!"</p>
<p>"This book says that in no time the end of the world will come, when almost all human beings will die. A few will survive and a few will be resurrected. The survivors will be able to come and go freely in the air, and their bodies won't be hurt by lightning, fire, radioactivity, weapons or anything else, and what's more, they won't get wet by rain."</p>
<p>"Why will they have such abilities?"</p>
<p>"It says the dimension of this world will ascend."</p>
<p>"What does that mean?"</p>
<p>"The survivors will have half physical half spiritual bodies."</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"Also, the ascension will extend to everything - the earth, animals, plants."</p>
<p>Daniel said to himself, "Probably we three are going to die."</p>
<p>"But it says a few people will rise back," said Father.</p>
<p>"How many people will survive?"</p>
<p>"It says nibu or sanbu people. It means twenty or thirty percent in conversations, but in maths it means two or three percent."</p>
<p>"Only two or three percent?"</p>
<p>"Yes, and the number includes the resurrected."</p>
<p>Daniel was struck silent.</p>
<p>Father went on, "But if her dream comes true, the world will be peaceful and joyful."</p>
<p>"But won't be there."</p>
<p>"This book says that we have to cleanse our souls. If we can do it, we will survive."</p>
<p>"That's the same as what Taro said."</p>
<p>"Yes, I think there's one truth in the universe."</p>
<p>Then it hit Daniel, "I remember what Taro told me ? Larissa will have an unbreakable body."</p>
<p>"Did he really say that?"</p>
<p>"Yes. So only she can survive. What are we going to do?"</p>
<p>Father regarded him with a severe expression.</p>
<p>"Cleanse our souls."</p>
<p>Then Larissa came down from upstairs.</p>
<p>"Can I go next door, Daddy?"</p>
<p>"OK. Don't eat too many sweets, Larissa."</p>
<p>"I know. Don't worry, Daddy. Bye."</p>
<p>"Are you going to take the book again?" Daniel asked.</p>
<p>"She likes listening to the tales."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>Larissa had often visited the old woman next door since they first met. The book was filled with Celtic stories and myths. She would read the book and retell it in Japanese.</p>
<p>"Interesting. You are very smart," the old woman said every time Larissa told her one of the stories.</p>
<p>If ever Larissa forgot to bring the book, the old woman would tell her stories of her own. The story of 'Urashima Taro' Larissa was especially interested in. She asked the old woman to tell her that one again and again.</p>
<p>"Why are you so interested in that tale?" one day the old woman asked her.</p>
<p>"I meet him sometimes," Larissa answered.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"In the story, he lived in the very early days of Japan. That's true, but since then, he has reincarnated many times. And he now lives again in Japan, although not on the earth.</p>
<p>"Oh, well, that's news to me. You know a lot of different people ... so where does he live?"</p>
<p>"Uh, I can't tell you that, sorry."</p>
<p>"No problem. You've promised not to tell, eh?"</p>
<p>"Yes ... but I've told you about him."</p>
<p>"Don't worry. I'm going to forget that soon."</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"Even if I don't forget, I'll never tell anyone."</p>
<p>"Thanks, grandma."</p>
<p>"But if you're ever allowed to, will you tell me more about him?"</p>
<p>"Of course."</p>
<p>"I'd like to meet him if the occasion arises."</p>
<p>"I'd like you to meet him, too."</p>
<p>Larissa ached to tell her about the impending catastrophe, but she resisted.</p>
<p>"Anyway how are your grandparents? You've never mentioned them."</p>
<p>"Daddy's mother and father live in Britain, and Mummy's mother went to heaven last year.</p>
<p>"Oh, that's a pity."</p>
<p>"I like her very much."</p>
<p>"Like? You mean liked, don't you?"</p>
<p>"No, I've met her sometimes, although she is now a spirit."</p>
<p>"Uh, OK. And your grandpa?"</p>
<p>"I don't know because he went to heaven when I was a baby."</p>
<p>"A-ha. Have you also met him?"</p>
<p>"No ... but occasionally I feel an old man's presence. It may be my grandpa."</p>
<p>"OK, good ... good," the old woman looked like she was thinking something about Larissa.</p>
<p>"Is it OK to have told me that?"</p>
<p>"Oh, It's a secret, too. But no problem. It's just my secret, so I can tell whoever I want."</p>
<p>"I see," the old woman said, "I have a secret, too."</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I live here with my husband."</p>
<p>"What! Your husband died twenty years ago, you said so before."</p>
<p>"That's right, but he has stayed here with me, so I haven't felt lonely."</p>
<p>"Now I know. I've always felt a presence in this room. That must be your husband."</p>
<p>"I bet you can see spirits, can't you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm sure it is that because it feels gentle."</p>
<p>"Oh, he looks pleased that you visited."</p>
<p>"I can feel that, too."</p>
<p>Then the old woman beckoned the presence to come closer.</p>
<p>"Why are you staying here," asked Larissa.</p>
<p>"...................................."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"...................................."</p>
<p>"I see. And do you know the day?"</p>
<p>The old woman asked, "What is he saying?"</p>
<p>"Can't you hear him?"</p>
<p>"No, I can't. Just having him around is a comfort.</p>
<p>"OK. Would you wait for a while, grandma?"</p>
<p>"Certainly."</p>
<p>"And," Larissa asked him again, "Would you tell me that in more detail?"</p>
<p>"..................................................................................................."</p>
<p>"OK, thank you, grandpa."</p>
<p>Larissa looked back to the old woman and said, "He said he knew he had to go to heaven, but that he was waiting for you."</p>
<p>"Waiting for me?"</p>
<p>"You see, your soul and his were one before your birth. Then that soul divided into two and came to this world. So he thinks the two of you must go back to the other world together."</p>
<p>"He doesn't have to wait for me"</p>
<p>"Well, you don't have to worry about that. In his dimension there's no time."</p>
<p>"I don't quite understand."</p>
<p>"In his dimension there's just variation. For us the variation looks like the passage of time, but it is different from that."</p>
<p>"OK. By the way does he know the day I'm going to leave this world?"</p>
<p>"He doesn't know exactly ... and he can't tell you about that anyway."</p>
<p>„ÄÄ"I see."</p>
<p>"I feel that ... you're not going to die."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" the old woman asked surprisingly.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure but ... you may be alive forever in the new world in the higher dimension."</p>
<p>"Oh, sounds good."</p>
<p>"Uh, he also said another important thing ... I don't know whether I should tell you or not."</p>
<p>Larissa stared fixedly at the presence. She was obviously communicating, but her lips didn't move. Their communication looked direct ? mind to mind.</p>
<p>After a while she said to the old woman, "It's OK. He said I could tell you. He is also waiting for another spirit. This spirit is hunting for all of its past associates. And you and your husband were once its associates.</p>
<p>"Huh? Why is the spirit hunting for us?"</p>
<p>"Your husband said there's a place you have to go to together when all of the associates have been found and gathered."</p>
<p>"Where is that place?"</p>
<p>"I think it is in a different dimension or another world."</p>
<p>"OK, and why do we have to go there together?"</p>
<p>"I don't know but ... your husband told me that a big transformation will come soon. Maybe that's why."</p>
<p>"Do you know what the big transformation will be?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Very well ..., OK, thanks for telling me what my husband said."</p>
<p>"Not at all. It was fun. But I have to go back now."</p>
<p>"Yes, it's coming to evening."</p>
<p>"See you soon, grandma."</p>
<p>She left the old woman's house.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 9</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>The Beginning of The End</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>Some time had passed since the last meeting with Taro. Day by day Larissa had become more disconcerted, but she herself didn't know why. One night Larissa had a dream where a huge tsunami swallowed her house. She felt her body trembling with fear, and she woke up. Next morning she told Daniel about the dream.</p>
<p>"I wonder if it will come true," Daniel said, "You had better ask Taro whether the tsunami really occurs."</p>
<p>"But he said the last time we met I could see on my own from now on."</p>
<p>"So can you?"</p>
<p>"No, I can't."</p>
<p>At that moment the ground started to shake. He took her hand at once, but the earthquake soon calmed down.</p>
<p>"It's not safe here, either. What shall we do?" Daniel said.</p>
<p>"I wonder if we ought to move to another place."</p>
<p>"Ah, I'll ask Dad."</p>
<p>*„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ *</p>
<p>Three days later Daniel still hadn't asked Dad.</p>
<p>Larissa asked Daniel after dinner, "When are you going to ask Daddy?"</p>
<p>"We have to discus tactics, so let's go upstairs."</p>
<p>When the two went upstairs, they hear knocks at the window. They looked at each other.</p>
<p>"It must be Taro," Daniel said and went to the window to open it.</p>
<p>"Hi, I thought you would come," Larissa told Taro.</p>
<p>"Sorry that I couldn't come earlier. I've been busy salvaging people with clear souls, because, as you know, many earthquakes have been occurring all over the world."</p>
<p>"Yes, that's true," Daniel replied, "but what we want to know is -."</p>
<p>"All right. I'll cut to the chase. A very high tsunami will hit here, and of course a big earthquake, too. You will all have to leave."</p>
<p>"I saw that in my dream, and ... where should we go?" Larissa asked.</p>
<p>"Uh, it's difficult to say."</p>
<p>"Don't you know?"</p>
<p>"This time there won't be many safe places because huge earthquakes and huge tsunamis will occur everywhere. So there will be very few survivors."</p>
<p>"I've prepared for the worst. I know I won't survive," Daniel said, "but ... you said the big change will come. What is it going to be like?"</p>
<p>"Uh, the dimension of our world will ascend by half stage."</p>
<p>"Half stage? What does that mean?"</p>
<p>"The survivors will become half material and half spiritual. And every object, too."</p>
<p>"OK, but ... I can't see why this world has to change."</p>
<p>"Um, OK. Do you two have time?"</p>
<p>"Yes. We have finished dinner."</p>
<p>"Your parents won't come upstairs?"</p>
<p>"No, they will think we are sleeping as long as we don't make a noise."</p>
<p>"Then we can go out?"</p>
<p>"Go out?"</p>
<p>"Yes. But you will leave your bodies behind."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Just your spirits can go out."</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"Of course. It may be a little difficult for you, but it should be easy for Larissa."</p>
<p>"Are you going to make a tunnel?"</p>
<p>"No. It takes time to do that. With just our spirits, we can go wherever we like quickly.</p>
<p>"That's convenient!"</p>
<p>"OK. Would you lie down on your beds?"</p>
<p>Daniel and Larissa lay themselves on their beds.</p>
<p>"Close your eyes and try to feel the wave of my spirit. Now I'll conduct your spirits."</p>
<p>Taro found Larissa soon came out of her body.</p>
<p>"Oh, I feel free. Marvellous!" she said, "How about Daniel?"</p>
<p>"He can't get out of his body. Would you dive into his body and bring him?"</p>
<p>"What! Can I do that?"</p>
<p>"Try it. I think you can do it better than me."</p>
<p>"OK. I'll try."</p>
<p>Larissa went into Daniel's body.</p>
<p>"What are you doing, Daniel?"</p>
<p>"Oh, how did you get in here?"</p>
<p>"I'm pure spirit now, so I can go anywhere ? even into a body. Come with me."</p>
<p>"How?"</p>
<p>"Trust me. I'll lead you. Uh, reach out your hand."</p>
<p>Larissa took his hand and jumped out of his body.</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm floating. How cool!" Daniel shouted.</p>
<p>"OK. Let's go," Taro said.</p>
<p>"Where are we going?" asked Daniel.</p>
<p>"I'd like to show you some places and scenes. Larissa, take my hands. Daniel take this one"</p>
<p>The three went though the highest point of the roof and up to a level above the clouds in the night sky.</p>
<p>"Now we go to Africa," told Taro.</p>
<p>"But that's so far," said Daniel.</p>
<p>"No, there's no time and no distance in the dimension of spirit."</p>
<p>In an instant they were hovering above a wasteland in the day time.</p>
<p>"Can you see all those tents?"</p>
<p>"Yes. What's that?" asked Daniel.</p>
<p>"It's a refugee camp. They have no place to live. Members of their families were killed either by the rebels or by government troops."</p>
<p>"Why did they have to die?"„ÄÄasked Larissa.</p>
<p>"Because the bosses of the rebels and government troops ordered or permitted their men to kill them."</p>
<p>"Why did the bosses order or permit such a thing?"</p>
<p>"They wanted to rule unopposed."</p>
<p>"Why? Do they get pleasure from that?"</p>
<p>"They feel superior, so they have no qualms about treating people like animals."</p>
<p>"Crazy!"</p>
<p>"Yes, but they don't feel like they are committing a sin."</p>
<p>"Unbelievable!"</p>
<p>"And the people in the camp are killing each other, too."</p>
<p>"Why?" asked Larisa again.</p>
<p>"Because they are of different religions and different races."</p>
<p>"Is that the reason?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"How foolish!" Daniel said, "I didn't know adults could be so foolish."</p>
<p>"You might act the same," Taro replied, "in that situation."</p>
<p>Larissa asked, "We all have the same essence?"</p>
<p>"That's right."</p>
<p>"But I'd never do such a thing."</p>
<p>"I know, your soul has been polished."</p>
<p>"How about me?" Daniel asked.</p>
<p>Larissa said to Daniel, "Your ego is still a little too strong."</p>
<p>Daniel stared at her, "How do you know that?"</p>
<p>"I felt that when I dived into your body."</p>
<p>"OK," Taro said, "Now we go to the next place."</p>
<p>"Where's that?" Daniel asked.</p>
<p>"The Middle East."</p>
<p>They headed north hand in hand and soon they were above Jerusalem.</p>
<p>"Can you see the town?" Taro asked.</p>
<p>"Yes," Daniel answered, "there's a church, there's a synagogue, there's a mosque and there's some houses."</p>
<p>"Wow! You know your temples."</p>
<p>"I've seen them on TV."</p>
<p>"Me, too," Larissa said.</p>
<p>"There have been countless battles for this place by followers of Judaism, Islam, Catholicism and Protestantism."</p>
<p>"It has continued to this day?" asked Daniel.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"But why?"</p>
<p>Larissa cut in, "Jesus said, 'He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her, you know?"</p>
<p>"Yeah ... but what does that mean?" Daniel asked.</p>
<p>"I don't know exactly but I think that means you must not punish anybody."</p>
<p>"How did you know that phrase?"</p>
<p>"I just felt God's spirit. It sometimes guides me."</p>
<p>"Great!" Taro said, "God's spirit has settled in your soul."</p>
<p>"But I don't know the meaning." Daniel said to Taro.</p>
<p>"OK, the woman in the phrase was an adulteress, and 'cast a stone' refers to one of the punishments in those days. Some people brought her to the execution place because they were going to see what Jesus would say. But they eventually left as there wasn't a man who hadn't committed any sins."</p>
<p>"It just hit me," Larissa suddenly said, "Hatred just makes hatred. Only the rule of the universe can punish people ... uh, the universe wants us to forgive each other. Actually the universe doesn't want to punish people because the essence of the universe is love."</p>
<p>Daniel stared at her, "You've really become smart."</p>
<p>"You will, too."</p>
<p>"But I don't know how."</p>
<p>Then Taro said to him, "It's easy to be like that if you take the ego off your mind."</p>
<p>"But I think it's difficult."</p>
<p>"Have courage and decisiveness, and it become possible."</p>
<p>"OK, ...so if the people here have that, the battles will stop?"</p>
<p>"Yes. But that isn't enough. They have to give up the thought that only they themselves are right."</p>
<p>Then Larissa shouted, "Look! That girl's going to the market. She is going to blow herself up!"</p>
<p>"How do you know that?" asked Daniel.</p>
<p>"Can't you see? Under her coat she has some bombs twisted around herself."</p>
<p>"She is still a teenager," said Taro.</p>
<p>"We have to stop her." Daniel said, "Taro, Larissa, can't you do someth-."</p>
<p>At that moment the bombs burst.</p>
<p>"Oh, my God!" the three shouted all at once.</p>
<p>"How terrible!" Daniel was half crying, "Why couldn't anyone stop her?"</p>
<p>Taro and Larissa couldn't give him answer. In the market chaos broke out in a second. The scene was unbearable to watch.</p>
<p>After a while Daniel said to himself, "Looks to me like the world is ending."</p>
<p>"We had better leave for the next place," told Taro.</p>
<p>"No, we have to rescue the injured," Larissa said.</p>
<p>"You two are spirits now, so you can't do anything.</p>
<p>"Oh, I'd forgotten that. But you can do something."</p>
<p>"No, in this case I'm forbidden by headquarters."</p>
<p>"Oh, God."</p>
<p>Daniel asked, "Where are we going to?"</p>
<p>"The American Continent ? in ancient times."</p>
<p>"In ancient times?" he asked, "Can we go?"</p>
<p>"Of course. I said there's no time and no distance in the dimension of spirit."</p>
<p>"Oh, now I understand what you mean."</p>
<p>"There are many kinds of creatures being wiped off the face of the earth these days, aren't there?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, lots of scientists say so."</p>
<p>"We can learn important things from ancient people."</p>
<p>The three came to a point in the sky above some forest land in which Native Americans were settled.</p>
<p>"Now we are fourteen thousand years in the past," Taro said, "I'll quickly show you the alteration of their way of life."</p>
<p>"Oh, they are hunting, "Larissa shouted, "I've never seen that animal."</p>
<p>"That's right. They have been made extinct."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"People hunted too many of them. In two thousand years they were wiped out. Not only that other kinds of animals were made extinct."</p>
<p>"How cruel! Didn't the people know it was wrong?"</p>
<p>"They didn't know what serious effects their actions would bring. Because they were devoting their energies to getting food and to knowing what animals and plants there were, as they had just come to this continent."</p>
<p>Daniel said in addition, "But they had stayed there for two thousand years, yeah?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but they didn't understand the meaning of what they were doing until some of the animals had vanished."</p>
<p>Larissa said, "These days many kinds of animals keep vanishing, even though we know animals are being wiped out on the earth."</p>
<p>Daniel asked Taro, "And ... what did they do?"</p>
<p>"They stopped hunting so many of the same animal. They only hunted a few of each animal. This allowed the populations of the animals to increase."</p>
<p>"Did it go well?"</p>
<p>"For twelve thousand years after that, they didn't wipe out a single animal."</p>
<p>"Oh, good."</p>
<p>"But since Europeans have come here, many kinds of animals have vanished."</p>
<p>"Didn't the Europeans learn from them?"</p>
<p>"No. On the contrary the Europeans killed them."</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"Yes. In addition about forty million died from diseases they caught from the Europeans."</p>
<p>"Forty million!"</p>
<p>"They also wiped many kinds of animals off the face of this continent."</p>
<p>"What for?"</p>
<p>"Money ... and sometimes they hunted animals and Native the Americans just for play."</p>
<p>"That's unbelievable!"</p>
<p>"Off course some Native Americans fought back but it was mostly futile, because they didn't have guns."</p>
<p>"Disgusting!"</p>
<p>"Do not say such a word," Larissa blamed Daniel, "You know, the Japanese Army killed many millions of people in China and Korea in the Second World War."</p>
<p>"I knew, and the Nazis killed about six million people in Europe. Taro said so before."</p>
<p>"Oh, you remember."</p>
<p>"Of course. It seems to me most leaders then were crazy and their followers, too."</p>
<p>Taro replied, "The situation is not very different now. Almost all of the leaders in the world today are crazy. I can't understand why people elect them."</p>
<p>Daniel and Larissa were a little surprised at the use of the word 'crazy' by Taro. He quickly sensed what the two had felt.</p>
<p>Daniel asked , "You really think so?"</p>
<p>"I'm afraid I do. You can't guess the abnormality of their ideas. The wave motion of their thoughts has created this situation."</p>
<p>"You said before that many huge earthquakes would occur all over the world. I thought that was Armageddon."</p>
<p>"If it were fifty or a hundred years ago, there could have been things done to prevent the coming situation. From now on many things will happen one after another."</p>
<p>"Oh, God."</p>
<p>Taro looked at the two and said lastly, "I'd like you to see some other scenes, but it's time today."</p>
<p>"We have to go back now?" Larissa asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, I'll take you to different places in different periods next time. That's enough shocks for one day."</p>
<p>"OK,"</p>
<p>The three started to go back home hand in hand.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 10</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>The Sign of The Change</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>Daniel was reading a book in his bedroom about the ancient Mayan civilization which his father had bought. According to the Mayans, our world was the fourth world ? the first one perished with fire, the second one perished with ice and the third one perished with water. Daniel thought, then, how will the fourth one end? He gasped ? by all of them.</p>
<p>Daniel knew the ancient Mayan people had their own calendars, from a shorter cycle one to a longer cycle one. Now the European calendar's term is one year and the Japanese calendar can go up to sixty years. Then what was the longest Mayan calendar? Daniel wondered. The answer was written accurately in the record. It started on the thirteenth of August 3114 B.C. and would finish on the twenty first of December 2012 A.D.</p>
<p>Daniel said to himself, "That's soon!" He stood up and shouted, Dad! Mum! Where are you?"</p>
<p>He went to the window and opened it. He looked down to the field but he couldn't see them.</p>
<p>"I have something to ask!</p>
<p>He rushed down the stairs hastily.</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" Mother's voice came from the kitchen and when he ran into the living room, he found Father there.</p>
<p>"Oh, you are here," Daniel said.</p>
<p>"What's up?"</p>
<p>"Do you know the Mayan Calendar?"</p>
<p>"You mean the longest- term calendar?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Let me guess. It's about 2012. The end of world."</p>
<p>"You know about that?"</p>
<p>"I read the book, too. But you don't need to be surprised."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"If it is fixed, we can't change it. If it's not, you don't need to worry. The end of the world will come some other time."</p>
<p>"But ... we might all die out."</p>
<p>"Even if human beings are destined to become extinct, we are mortal in any case."</p>
<p>"I know. But can't we do anything?"</p>
<p>"As usual in our limited lives, all we must do is our best."</p>
<p>"As usual?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Don't you always do your best?"</p>
<p>"Uh, I try to."</p>
<p>Daniel had nothing more to say, so he went back to his bedroom.</p>
<p>*„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ *</p>
<p>In the evening the family were having dinner in the living room.</p>
<p>"Why don't you eat more, Larissa?" Mother asked, "Do you feel bad?"</p>
<p>"No, not at all. But I don't want to eat. Can I finish?"</p>
<p>"Don't say later that you're hungry."</p>
<p>"I won't."</p>
<p>After dinner Father said to the children, "I'm going to Sapporo for work next week. I found a job."</p>
<p>"Yes!" the children yelled, "Congratulations!"</p>
<p>"But," Father said, "I can't commute from here. I have to live in Sapporo."</p>
<p>"Oh, no," the two said and Larissa asked, "Can I go with you, Daddy?"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, but no. I'll come back every weekend."</p>
<p>"I want to live with you in Sapporo."</p>
<p>"I don't think that will be possible. I'll have to come home late every day. Who's going to make you dinner."</p>
<p>Daniel said to her, "Yeah, and you'd have to change schools."</p>
<p>"I know all that. I just don't want us to be apart. We might not meet again."</p>
<p>They all fell silent. Larissa's words had often come true.</p>
<p>*„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ*</p>
<p>Next morning Larissa couldn't finish any portion of her breakfast.</p>
<p>"You've just had a bit of bread and a sip of milk."</p>
<p>"Sorry, Mummy. But I don't want any more."</p>
<p>"You are a child. You have to eat more."</p>
<p>"But I can't."</p>
<p>"OK, then ... Just drink this glass of milk."</p>
<p>Larissa drank it reluctantly.</p>
<p>"OK."</p>
<p>Mother was concerned about Larissa because she didn't much for dinner last night, too.</p>
<p>After a while Mother heard Daniel shout from upstairs.</p>
<p>"Mum! Larissa's vomiting!"</p>
<p>Mother went to their room hastily and found that Larissa had vomited all she'd eaten onto the tatami floor.</p>
<p>The parents took her to the nearest clinic which was an hour drive way from their house. But on the way Larissa started to feel better. The doctor couldn't find the cause of her symptoms.</p>
<p>In the evening Larissa ate half of her meal. The next day and the day after that she ate less than a half of it. Mother felt that the amount Larissa ate was getting less day by day. But strangely Larissa was quite healthy. Mother would sometimes order her to eat more, but every time she did Larissa vomited.</p>
<p>In the meantime Daniel didn't worry about Larissa. He felt someday she wouldn't need to eat. He'd heard there were more than ten people in the world who didn't have to eat, and yet, they were quite healthy. It seemed to him there going to be more of those kinds of people.</p>
<p>*„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ*</p>
<p>It was the Saturday of the week Father had left for Sapporo by bus. Larissa felt out of sorts all day long. In the evening there were two weak earthquakes. At night Larissa suddenly lightened, when she heard a knock at the window.</p>
<p>"Hi, can you go on a trip tonight?" Taro asked directly.</p>
<p>"Of course!"</p>
<p>"Hello, that was good timing," Daniel said, "Larissa's been feeling depressed ever since Father went to Sapporo."</p>
<p>"She didn't want her family to split."</p>
<p>"That's right. You know well."</p>
<p>"I just felt the wave of her soul. Anyway you both have to get out of your bodies."</p>
<p>"Yes, but I'm not sure I can do it by myself."</p>
<p>"Try it."</p>
<p>"OK."</p>
<p>Daniel and Larissa lay themselves on their beds. And soon Larissa came out of her body.</p>
<p>"Are you a spirit now or not?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Uh, I'm always with my body, but despite this I can go anywhere just like a spirit."</p>
<p>"Oh, how convenient!"</p>
<p>"How's Daniel going?"</p>
<p>"I'll fetch him from his body."</p>
<p>When she tried to go into his body, he suddenly came out.</p>
<p>Larissa shouted, "Daniel, you did it!"</p>
<p>"Really? I did it? Isn't this my body?" he asked as he felt around his chest.</p>
<p>"No," Taro answered, "Look at your bed."</p>
<p>"Oh, that's my body. I really did it!"</p>
<p>"OK. Let's go to Zaire."</p>
<p>"Zaire?" asked Daniel.</p>
<p>"Now it's called Congo."</p>
<p>"Where is it?"</p>
<p>"In the west of middle Africa."</p>
<p>Larissa asked, "Are we going to Africa again?"</p>
<p>"But this time another place. Once a very awful thing happened there."</p>
<p>"OK. Would you take our hands?" Larissa said as she held out her hand.</p>
<p>Taro grasped their hands and said, "Here we go."</p>
<p>They were soon hovering above a large facility.</p>
<p>"We are now several decades in the past," Taro said, "That's a bacteriological research facility."</p>
<p>"In such a backward country?" Daniel asked.</p>
<p>"This was built by the U.S."</p>
<p>"What for?"</p>
<p>"Have you heard Jean-Pierre Petit?"</p>
<p>"Hang on! What are you talking about?"</p>
<p>"Petit presented the contents of some letters that aliens had randomly sent to humans. From the letters it was learnt that the U.S. government had rented this area to study bacteriological weapons."</p>
<p>"Uh, probably the U.S government feared that some accidents might happen."</p>
<p>"That's right. And unfortunately their fears came true."</p>
<p>"Oh, no."</p>
<p>"The researchers kept some infected monkeys, but the Zairean guards let them slip out of the building. They looked for the monkeys and caught them, but in doing so, the Zairean guards were bitten."</p>
<p>"Look!" suddenly Larissa shouted, "What Taro said is happening! Over there!"</p>
<p>Daniel and Taro watched as a few guards grappled with one of the monkeys.</p>
<p>"Can you guess the name of the infectious disease?" Taro asked Daniel.</p>
<p>"I have no idea."</p>
<p>"AIDS."</p>
<p>Daniel was too surprised to say anything.</p>
<p>And Larissa said, "I thought the virus came after people had felled uninhabited forests. So you're saying AIDS was made by human beings."</p>
<p>"Yes, that's right."</p>
<p>Suddenly the scenery changed.</p>
<p>Taro continued, "Can you see? It's five years later."</p>
<p>Daniel said, "Oh, there are some people with spots on their skin. Where are we?"</p>
<p>"We are above a small village near the institute," answered Taro.</p>
<p>"Many thin people are lying around with tumours and no hair," said Larissa.</p>
<p>"Now ten years later."</p>
<p>"Look! Many people are dying!" Daniel shouted.</p>
<p>"Now fifteen years later."</p>
<p>"No. Stop it!" Larissa suddenly started crying.</p>
<p>Taro and Daniel shut their mouths and stared at her.</p>
<p>"Sorry, Larissa," Taro calmly said, "I didn't mean to shock-."</p>
<p>"No," she interrupted him, "You're not to blame for that. In a vision I saw that uncountable numbers of people are dying of AIDS."</p>
<p>"There you go. From here AIDS started to spread all over the world. Nowadays over ten thousand people a day die from AIDS."</p>
<p>"Ten thousand!" Daniel said.</p>
<p>"In addition, the number of people with AIDS increases by five million every year. And forty million people have already died of AIDS."</p>
<p>Daniel said quietly, "I understand why you said this world would end. I'm sure that it's too late to change this world for the better."</p>
<p>"Can we go back home, Taro?" Larissa asked.</p>
<p>"Of course we can."</p>
<p>Larissa held out her hand. Taro smiled at her and took it. They went back home. When Taro was about to go to his space ship, Larissa asked him, "Would you stay a little more?"</p>
<p>"No problem."</p>
<p>"I want to know more about the huge tsunami. You told us before it would come, didn't you?"</p>
<p>"Ah, yes. It's better you leave soon."</p>
<p>Daniel asked, "Don't you know the exact day?"</p>
<p>"I can't really tell you that. But Larissa will be safe anywhere she is because she is becoming a spiritual being. And ..."</p>
<p>"You don't have to say any more," Daniel said, "I know the rest of us won't be safe."</p>
<p>"I believe you will be safe, Daniel."</p>
<p>"Thank you anyway, but I don't have much confidence. And I'm very worried about our parents."</p>
<p>"Sorry, but I can't say anything about that."</p>
<p>"OK, Taro."</p>
<p>"I want to go to bed," Larissa said.</p>
<p>"Oh, you are tiered tonight," said Taro.</p>
<p>"She's had some shocks," Daniel said to Taro, "OK, see you, Taro."</p>
<p>"See you," and he said to Larissa, "Good night."</p>
<p>*„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ *</p>
<p>Next morning Daniel told Mother that a huge tsunami would come soon and they had to leave their house.</p>
<p>"Did Larissa say that?" Mother asked.</p>
<p>"No. Taro told us."</p>
<p>"OK, I'll talk to Dad."</p>
<p>In the evening when they had dinner, Mother said to Daniel, "I wonder if Taro knows exactly when the tsunami will come."</p>
<p>"He told me he didn't know."</p>
<p>Larissa said, "I'd like to go to Daddy's apartment."</p>
<p>"I've talked to Daddy," Mother said, "And we are going to leave for Sapporo this weekend."</p>
<p>"Yes!" Larissa exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Will we all fit in Daddy's apartment?" Daniel asked.</p>
<p>"We'll have to. At least for a while, until we find something bigger."</p>
<p>"I see."</p>
<p>"So I will need you to help me pack up our things."</p>
<p>"OK, Mum."</p>
<p>From the next day Daniel and Larissa both stopped going to school, and helped their mother prepare for the move.</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>CHAPTER 11</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>The Unravelling</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>Saturday morning Larissa, Daniel and Mother left for Sapporo. The car was full of many necessities. After two hours their car arrived in Sapporo.</p>
<p>"How much longer is it?" Daniel asked.</p>
<p>"I guess about twenty minutes," answered Mother.</p>
<p>Then Larissa shouted suddenly, "Stop, Mummy!"</p>
<p>Mother stepped on the brake. The next moment a huge sway attacked them. Mother pulled in her head and Daniel grabbed his head, but Larissa sat up and took in the situation around them.</p>
<p>"Look, Daniel!"</p>
<p>"No, I can't!" he said as he clung to the front sheet.</p>
<p>"Mummy, look! The houses are collapsing!"</p>
<p>"Oh, God!" she had a glance as she continued to grip the steering wheel.</p>
<p>Although their car was shaking violently, strangely Larissa's body remained still.</p>
<p>When the sway had calmed down, Larissa shouted again, "Tsunami will come!"</p>
<p>"We are safe here," Daniel said, "The coast is fairly far."</p>
<p>"No, it's fifty metres high! Mummy, we've got to get to high building!"</p>
<p>"OK," Mother started the car, "Look for one, Daniel."</p>
<p>"OK, Mum."</p>
<p>Mother drove the car slowly to avoid the fallen debris and after about one hundred metres, they came to a break in the road. The road in front of them was lower. Mother stopped the car and Daniel got out to have a look.</p>
<p>"About thirty centimetres," he said, holding his hands apart.</p>
<p>"I'll try," said Mother, "Get out, Larissa."</p>
<p>"All right."</p>
<p>The car moved forward and dropped down to the lower side with a thud.</p>
<p>"Are you OK, Mum?" Daniel jogged up to the car and asked.</p>
<p>"I'm OK but I don't know if our car is."</p>
<p>The two children got into the car, and Daniel told Mother to turn on the radio. Mother switched it on but there was only static.</p>
<p>"Damn it!"</p>
<p>"Don't say things like that," Larissa told him, "People don't even know the tsunami will come. You tell them, Daniel."</p>
<p>"Me?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Now please!"</p>
<p>"Don't you know they are stunned? Nobody will listen to me."</p>
<p>Larissa opened the window on her side.</p>
<p>"A TSUNAMI WILL COME SOON!" she cried out, "A TSUNAMI WILL COME SOON!"</p>
<p>It first seemed that no one had noticed her, but a teenage boy looked at her as the car passed him. He looked very frightened. One moment later he cried out the words, too, ""A TSUNAMI WILL COME SOON!"</p>
<p>And some people around him started to shout the same words. The shouts quickly spread from person to person. The spread of the wave was as fast as the speed of their car. Daniel was very surprised.</p>
<p>"Daniel, shout it, too."</p>
<p>He came to himself and hastily opened the window on his side.</p>
<p>"A TSUNAMI WILL COME SOON!"</p>
<p>Mother drove carefully as she looked for high buildings.</p>
<p>"I found one!" she said at last, but next moment she moaned, "Oh, my God!"</p>
<p>The tall apartment house started to lean towards the road.</p>
<p>"That's unbelievable," Daniel mumbled.</p>
<p>"No!" Larissa shrieked as she wept, "It'll collapse soon!"</p>
<p>They saw some people crying for help through the broken windows. Then the building started collapsing.</p>
<p>"Don't look!" Mother shouted.</p>
<p>But the two children saw some people falling with the broken building.</p>
<p>"OH, MY GOD!" the two screamed.</p>
<p>Mother turned the car into a road on the left.</p>
<p>Daniel told Mother, "Stop the car."</p>
<p>As soon as Mother stopped it, he ran out.</p>
<p>After a while he came back and said, "They say there's a hospital hear here. Apparently it's quite high. Turn right at the next crossroad and go straight for about one hundred metres. It will be on the left."</p>
<p>"OK, well done," Mother said.</p>
<p>When they got there, the nurses and the doctors were talking to patients outside the hospital.</p>
<p>"Has the hospital has been damaged?" Mother asked one of the nurses.</p>
<p>"The building itself is OK, but it's dangerous to stay inside, there may be cracks in the gas pipes and loose wires everywhere," the nurse answered, "and there might be an aftershock."</p>
<p>"Go back, please!" standing by Mother, Larissa cried.</p>
<p>The nurse stared at Larissa in surprise.</p>
<p>"Uh ...," Mother said, "my daughter can see the near future."</p>
<p>The nurse hesitated.</p>
<p>Then Daniel suddenly shouted, "BIG TSUNAMI WILL COME SOON!"</p>
<p>Some people looked at him in fright.</p>
<p>"GO BACK TO THE HOSPITAL! YOU WILL BE SAFE ON THE ROOF!"</p>
<p>Some people's faces turned to fear. They made to go back, but the rest couldn't take seriously the words of a small boy.</p>
<p>"IT WAS ON THE RADIO!"</p>
<p>No one had a radio, so they had no choice but to believe him. At first only a few people started to go back, then as one of the people from the surrounding area said they heard a tsunami was coming, the current changed. Everyone ran for the entrance.</p>
<p>Daniel said in a low voice, "I did it."</p>
<p>"But you told a lie," Larissa accused him, "The radio didn't work."</p>
<p>Mother said, "Well, as the proverb goes, a lie is often expedient."</p>
<p>There were two aftershocks, but fortunately they were weak. When almost all of the patients, nurses, doctors and staff had made it to the roof, they heard an odd sound like the ground runbling.</p>
<p>"Is that a tsunami?" someone asked.</p>
<p>Then Larissa shouted to people below, "COME UP HERE! A TSUNAMI IS COMING!"</p>
<p>The people on the ground, who had been moving around in confusion, stopped in their tracks.</p>
<p>"COME UP HERE, NOW!" she shouted again.</p>
<p>Following Larissa, many of the people on the roof started to call, too, "A tsunami is coming! Hurry! Come up here!"</p>
<p>The people on the ground quickly ran to the entrance of the hospital. But not everyone could get to the roof, because the roof was already full and the staircases were filling with people.</p>
<p>Then a great shock came. A wave like a mountain attacked the building. People on the ground, houses around the hospital, trees and telegraph poles along the streets were swallowed in an instant.</p>
<p>On the roof cries, yells and shrieks went up, and inside the building some women and children cried with even more fear because they were blindfolded by the walls from the situation outside. In no time at all, three quarters of the building was under water. The people on the higher levels were safe but the people on the lower ones were swallowed up into the tide. Many scream rose here and there. The building swayed over and over.</p>
<p>Larissa, who had been watching the circumstances calmly, suddenly shouted, "Oh, my God!"</p>
<p>"What's up?" Daniel asked.</p>
<p>"The ground will split!"</p>
<p>Then the next aftershock came. The people on the roof clung to whatever they could but some at the edges fell down into the tide. Every window pane shattered. And next came a great howl from the earth.</p>
<p>"Now the earth is splitting," Larissa said.</p>
<p>The sound was like the roar of a million lions.</p>
<p>"Look!" she pointed towards downtown. But Daniel and Mother couldn't clearly observe her finger.</p>
<p>"Where?"</p>
<p>"Over there! I'll go to see! Daniel, come!"</p>
<p>"How?" Daniel looked at her. Her body was floating a little and getting transparent.</p>
<p>"Give me your hand!"</p>
<p>Daniel held out his hand. She took it, and his body was lifted.</p>
<p>"Mummy, we'll be back soon."</p>
<p>Then the tide started to run downtown. Larissa and Daniel went up to a high point in the sky and looked down.</p>
<p>"The water is flowing down to the rift," Larissa said, "Let's go, Daniel."</p>
<p>Moving downtown, the two saw a great wide pillar of smoke.</p>
<p>"Oh, terrible!" Daniel said when they approached the rift, "It's like Niagara Falls."</p>
<p>"Have you ever seen it?"</p>
<p>"On TV, silly."</p>
<p>The tide was flowing into the fissure along with many broken houses, shop things, trees, dogs, cats, people and all kinds of rubbish. From the depths of the fissure a huge wall of smoke rose high into the sky. Daniel turned pale.</p>
<p>"Are you OK?" Larissa asked.</p>
<p>But he couldn't say anything.</p>
<p>"Daniel, come on!"</p>
<p>"Ah ... I'm OK."</p>
<p>"We have to go back."</p>
<p>Larissa gripped his hand tightly and turned around, when she screamed suddenly. A crow had brushed against her. Although they hadn't noticed it, that was not the only one. Countless numbers of birds were flying high all over the city. Apart from crows, there were sparrows, kites, gulls and other kinds of birds.</p>
<p>"Oh, you can't find any places to perch," Larissa said.</p>
<p>Then Daniel pointed behind her, "Look. There are some people like us."</p>
<p>Larissa looked back and gazed at them. There were three of them, and they looked like a family. A moment later they waved to her.</p>
<p>"Let's go and say hello, Daniel."</p>
<p>They got up to them, and the family bowed with smiles.</p>
<p>"Many lives are being lost," one of them said, who looked like the father, "You two will have to have a disconsolate experience. But it's necessary for your souls to develop."</p>
<p>Suddenly tears fell down from Larissa's eyes. "Do you mean our„ÄÄfather?"</p>
<p>"Possibly, but you don't have to feel grief because, you know, death of the body is not death of the soul."</p>
<p>Then another member of the family said, who looked like the mother, "We have lost two children, and there is only this daughter left."</p>
<p>The mother nestled her. She looked the same age as Larissa.</p>
<p>The father said, "It's better for you to go back to your mother soon."</p>
<p>"Something has happened?" Daniel asked.</p>
<p>"I think your mother needs help."</p>
<p>"I see ... and I wonder if we can meet you again?"</p>
<p>"Of course. When your souls develop a little more, you can meet us anytime you like."</p>
<p>"OK. See you."</p>
<p>"See you soon."</p>
<p>Daniel and Larissa headed back towards the hospital. When the two landed on the roof, some of the patients lay dying.</p>
<p>"What's it like now?" mother asked.</p>
<p>"The water is falling into a huge fissure," Daniel answered, "along with a lot of debris and ... many people."</p>
<p>The people around him pricked up their ears. While Daniel continued to talk to Mother, Larissa went to one of the patients. She put her hand onto the chest of the old man and lowered her head as if to pray. The patient had been unconscious but after awhile he regained consciousness. Larissa soon stood up and headed for the next patient in a grave condition.</p>
<p>"There you are!" Daniel said.</p>
<p>Larissa leaning over one of the patients.</p>
<p>"Help him." She pointed another patient.</p>
<p>"How?"</p>
<p>"You can do it. Try, and you'll know the way."</p>
<p>Daniel hesitated.</p>
<p>"Hurry!" Larissa told him loudly.</p>
<p>"OK."</p>
<p>Daniel put his hand onto the chest of a middle-aged man the same way Larissa had. He tried to make his mind clear and pure earnestly, and he felt a wisp of white light which came down from the heavens to his head. The next moment he saw the white light go through his arm and into the body of the man. Soon the man opened his eyes and tried to say something.</p>
<p>"You don't need to say anything. You are safe now."</p>
<p>Daniel stood up, then someone took his hand. She looked thirteen or fourteen.</p>
<p>"Please come with me. My sister doesn't seem to be breathing."</p>
<p>Her face was pale. She led Daniel to her sister. He thought the sister was the same age as him. He put his hand onto her chest as he had done with the man. But she remained cold. The white light didn't come.</p>
<p>"Why?" Daniel said to himself. He tried to make his mind clear and pure again, but in vain.</p>
<p>"Daniel."</p>
<p>He looked up. The person calling him was his mother. Her eyes were full of tears.</p>
<p>"You did your best."</p>
<p>Daniel kept praying as if he couldn't hear his mother, and soon he felt a faint voice, "Thank you so much." It seemed to be the sister's, "but I had decided before my birth that I would die today."</p>
<p>"Really? I can't believe it," Daniel said in his mind.</p>
<p>"You know that souls cannot die, don't you? We all come to this world after deciding what we must experience. So don't worry about me."</p>
<p>"But your death will upset your sister."</p>
<p>"I know, but she also chose a path."</p>
<p>Then Mother with the older sister already nestled in one arm, held Daniel with the other.</p>
<p>One moment later someone shouted, "The current has changed!"</p>
<p>All of the people on the roof went to see.</p>
<p>"The tide has started to go back to the sea."</p>
<p>Then the building swayed heavily and rasped with a loud noise. There was panic on the roof. Women and children screamed but nobody could help them. At last the building leaned. As the people slipped, they didn't know where they were. They grasped one another so as not to be thrown over.</p>
<p>"Help!" among the cries the children heard the shriek. They recognised the voice. The two made for it from different places. Mother was hanging from the edge of the roof.</p>
<p>"MUM!" Daniel shouted and crept up to the edge.</p>
<p>"No," Mother told, "Stay back!"</p>
<p>One adult by Daniel held out his hand to help but he couldn't reach her.</p>
<p>"Help my mother, somebody!" Daniel cried.</p>
<p>Then Larissa approached the edge. Unlike everyone else, her body didn't shake. It seemed to float.</p>
<p>"Mummy, make your body to be light. Trust me. Anybody can do so."</p>
<p>Mother shook her head.</p>
<p>"Trust yourself!"</p>
<p>Then one of her hands was torn from the edge.</p>
<p>"MUM!" Daniel shrieked.</p>
<p>Then Larissa who was looking down asked faintly, "Is that you, Daddy?"</p>
<p>She stared at a point behind Mother. "Why are you there?"</p>
<p>The next moment Mother's body lifted in the air. It went up a little further and then dropped onto the roof.</p>
<p>"Are you OK, Mum?" Daniel asked.</p>
<p>Then suddenly Larissa jumped off the roof to the surface of the tide.</p>
<p>Mother and Daniel cried at once, "Larissa!"</p>
<p>"Daddy, where are you?" Larissa's voice faded away.</p>
<p>Then the sway began to calm. The tide was getting lower and the birds had already disappeared. At last the quiet came. The people on the roof didn't utter any words. The awful silence covered everyone.</p>
<p>After a while a shadow like a child's came up along the building. It stopped in the air above the roof. All the people stared at it. It was materialising. A voice broke the silence.</p>
<p>"Mummy, Daddy has gone."</p>
<p>Tears ran down her face.</p>
<p>"Come down, dear."</p>
<p>Mother held out her arm and Larissa grasped it. Mother nestled her and said, "I am safe now by the grace of Daddy."</p>
<p>But Larissa's tears didn't stop. Daniel watched the scene in silence.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 12</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>The Reunion</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>The night came. They couldn't go anywhere other than stay at the hospital, because their car had been taken away by the tsunami. Some survivors went down to the ground but the rest wouldn't go out of fear.</p>
<p>It was a cold night. Autumn had already come to this northern region. The people moved to the sickrooms on the floors that had escaped the attack of the tide. They brought boards up from the lower floors and nailed them to the window-frames to guard against the night wind. Although the boards blocked it, it wasn't easy to sleep because the floors were now slanted.</p>
<p>It was an ominous night. There was no light, no noise, no sign of creatures outside. What they could hear was just the faint noise of drops dripping from the floors below. But they sometimes heard people whisper and babies cry.</p>
<p>"I feel relief when babies cry," Mother said in the darkness, "That seems to be the vigorous breath of life."</p>
<p>"There was obstetrics and gynaecology in this hospital," Daniel replied.</p>
<p>"You know that well!" Larissa said in a low voice.</p>
<p>"What!" Daniel upset, "I haven't learned the words."</p>
<p>"Oh, you are becoming a new person like me."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Mm, wait a moment." Larissa kept quiet for a while.</p>
<p>Mother wondered what she was doing but Daniel felt she was meditating.</p>
<p>Larissa started to tell, "Your chakras are opening more and more each day. When all of your chakras are open, you will be released from the yoke of time and space, and you'll be able to access any information on the earth."</p>
<p>Daniel asked hesitatingly, "What is a chakra?"</p>
<p>"It is a centre of energy in the body. It is said we have seven chakras inside the body."</p>
<p>"Did you know that yourself?"</p>
<p>"Of course not. Just now I was given that information from my higher self."</p>
<p>"Higher self?"</p>
<p>"My higher self is the origin of me. We all have one. I and my higher self influence each other. If we can ask it, it will send us information.</p>
<p>Then Mother said, "Everyone's going to sleep now. Have the talk again tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Oh, OK," the two replied and covered themselves with their blankets.</p>
<p>Mother wanted them to sleep soon before they began to feel hungry. She already felt it. She knew that the amount of food Larissa took these days had been getting less, but it was strange that Daniel hadn't been complaining that he was hungry.</p>
<p>The next morning the people worried about water to and food. Some of them went out to see the scene around the hospital, and what they saw was fallen trees, drifted roofs, dirty bodies and a lot of rubbish. They wanted to know the situation in the city but there was no way. Two of the people had portable radios, but they couldn't pick up a signal. It seemed the broadcasting stations were not working.</p>
<p>Mother felt very hungry but she didn't say so, because she was afraid her children might awake to their own hunger.</p>
<p>While it was getting up noon, they found some people walking down from the direction of the city centre. And they were told that it was only people who had been on roofs and the higher floors of buildings that had been able to survive. And that the city centre had been worst hit, near the fissure there were no houses and no buildings.</p>
<p>The people hunted the hospital for food but they couldn't find any as the kitchen was on the lower floor. There was also no running water. They did find some vending machines and vacuum flasks.</p>
<p>Some of the children began to cry of hunger.</p>
<p>"Mummy, aren't you hungry?" Larissa asked before Mother could ask.</p>
<p>"How about you, Larissa?"</p>
<p>"I don't want to eat ... no, I don't need to eat."</p>
<p>Mother looked at Daniel, "How about you?"</p>
<p>"Neither do I."</p>
<p>"Are you OK, Mum?" Daniel asked back.</p>
<p>"Ah, I'll be OK."</p>
<p>In the afternoon the people were given a tinned beverage each that had been in the vending machines. Almost all of the people apart from the two children just kept lying on the floors so that they could bear the hunger for longer.</p>
<p>About four o'clock someone shouted, "Helicopters're coming!"</p>
<p>All the people in the rooms and corridors rushed to see. Some people even ran up to the roof. One of helicopters approached the hospital and the people on the roof waved their hands.</p>
<p>The loud speaker of the helicopter told, "Move back! Move back!"</p>
<p>It was getting lower and lower, and the next moment a large sack was dropped down from it. The helicopter rose up higher and flew away to the next building.</p>
<p>The contents of the sack were bottled water, cans of fish, packed rice, bread, milk-powder, salt, sugar, and so on. In the evening everyone in the hospital had a meagre but happy dinner. And that night they slept well.</p>
<p>The next morning people woke up optimistic. However, their optimism proved short lived. Someone in the hospital had gotten away with the food in the middle of the night. The sack had been on the highest floor by the staircase to the roof, but foolishly no one had kept watching on it. It seemed about five people had been involved. They had taken away half of the remaining food.</p>
<p>After breakfast people had a meeting to discuss measures against theft and ways to distribute the food. But the meeting fell into confusion because they each had their own views about the food.</p>
<p>The three joined in the meeting, but they soon wanted to leave.</p>
<p>Larissa said to herself, "Adults cannot agree on even easy things."</p>
<p>Daniel and Mother listened to her in silence.</p>
<p>Two days later people began to fight over the food.</p>
<p>Daniel said, "They might murder one another."</p>
<p>Mother stared at him. She had feared this might happen.</p>
<p>"Mummy," Larissa said, "I'd like to leave here."</p>
<p>"I wonder if there's a better place."</p>
<p>Daniel said, "If we can find a tent and some sleeping bags, we could stay in a forest near here."</p>
<p>"A forest? Where is it?" asked Larissa.</p>
<p>"Uh, I don't know. I mean if there was one. Mm ... Sapporo must be surrounded by mountains that are safe from the sea."</p>
<p>"That's right," Mother said, "Probably there're not far way. But as autumn is passing, it'll be very cold at night."</p>
<p>The three sank into a silence.</p>
<p>"But we may get some wild berries in the forests," Daniel said to Mother.</p>
<p>Larissa replied to Daniel, "Mummy cannot live just on berries, and winter will come soon."</p>
<p>"I know that, but there's no other way for us," Daniel talked back.</p>
<p>Mother said, "Anyway we have to look for tents and sleeping bags if we're going to leave."</p>
<p>"OK," Daniel replied, "Larissa, can you see a place where they are?"</p>
<p>"Uh, just moment."</p>
<p>Larissa shut her eyes and about thirty seconds later she opened them again.</p>
<p>"I saw some in the buildings around here."</p>
<p>"OK, let's go." Daniel said.</p>
<p>The three found a tent and two sleeping bags but they were drenched. They brought them back to the hospital and laid them out on the roof to dry. Soon a rumour the three were leaving was going about.</p>
<p>Next morning two nurses came up to them.</p>
<p>"Are you really going to leave? One of nurses asked.</p>
<p>"Uh, if it's possible." Mother said, "Why?"</p>
<p>"Can we go with you?"</p>
<p>The three stared at them.</p>
<p>Mother said, "We can't guarantee your safety."</p>
<p>"Never mind. We won't be safe here also."</p>
<p>Mother looked at her children.</p>
<p>"It's no problem for me," said Daniel.</p>
<p>A moment later Larissa said to the nurse, "So you will be helpful, then?"</p>
<p>"Of course. We'll do whatever's possible."</p>
<p>Mother said, "We have to help one another."</p>
<p>"OK," Daniel said, "Then we need to find more tents and sleeping bags."</p>
<p>"We will help you search for them," two nurses replied.</p>
<p>Daniel looked at Larissa, and she shut her eyes.</p>
<p>"Why ? ... I can't see anything," Larissa opened them and said.</p>
<p>"What's up?" Daniel asked.</p>
<p>"I don't know."</p>
<p>"I wonder if there are no tents and sleeping bags any more."</p>
<p>"I can't see any pictures, so I can't look for anything."</p>
<p>They gave up the search.</p>
<p>In the evening, surprisingly for the three, two more nurses and three patients came up and asked to go with them. The patients' conditions were not serious, and they could all walk. Mother said the same thing to them as she'd said to the first nurses. The new comers also agreed to her conditions.</p>
<p>Next morning Larissa tried to meditate again.</p>
<p>"I can do it," she said vigorously, "I can see the pictures."</p>
<p>Daniel replied, "Oh, you were saved the trouble of meditating two times."</p>
<p>They all went out to get tents and sleeping bags. They got two more tents and four more sleeping bags that day.</p>
<p>Larissa said at last, "I can't see any more."</p>
<p>"But we still need four more sleeping bags," Daniel said.</p>
<p>Mother replied, "We'll just have to make do with blankets."</p>
<p>Early the next morning, although the sleeping bags hadn't dry completely, the ten people left the hospital for the nearest mountain. It happened to be Mt. Teine. It was very fine and warm. They walked with a light step as if there was hope for the future.</p>
<p>After walking for three hours, they found a two-wheeled cart.</p>
<p>"Just what we need!" Daniel exclaimed, "But does it work?"</p>
<p>"What are the tyres like?" one of the patients asked.</p>
<p>He walked up to it and pressed his thumb down on each of the tyres.</p>
<p>"A little bit flat but they'll do the job."</p>
<p>"YES!" all the members yelled because they were tired from carrying their luggage.</p>
<p>In a few minutes all of the luggage had been loaded onto the cart. And so they moved faster. Each person took turns pulling the cart.</p>
<p>The altitude was getting higher and the road was getting steeper. They found that the houses in higher places had been safe, although some of the shabbier ones had collapsed. In the afternoon they approached the foot of Mt. Teine. Surprisingly dotted about were other people from the city.</p>
<p>"I wonder if there are any farmers around here," one of the nurses said.</p>
<p>Another person replied, "I heard there are only a few."</p>
<p>Daniel said, "If there are some farmers, we might get some food."</p>
<p>"We have food for today's dinner, but that's all," Mother said.</p>
<p>All the people were very tired and hungry.</p>
<p>Someone said, "We have to look for a place to stay tonight."</p>
<p>"It must be near a mountain stream. We need water," Mother said.</p>
<p>Then the person at the tail of the group replied, "There's a stream a bit further up. A stranger told me."</p>
<p>They found the mountain stream easily and pitched the tents by it. It was getting dark quickly. They had a simple dinner and soon wanted to sleep as they had walked a long way. Daniel and Larissa volunteered to use blankets, and two of the nurses did, too."</p>
<p>In the night Larissa and a nurse came out of their tents to have a pee.</p>
<p>"It's very cold," the nurse said.</p>
<p>"Look!" said Larissa as she pointed to the opposite side of the stream.</p>
<p>"Oh, foxes. They are maybe a mother and her children."</p>
<p>"They are looking at us. They think of us as their fellows."</p>
<p>"What? ... Ah, you mean we are survivors?"</p>
<p>"Yes. We are under the same destiny on the earth."</p>
<p>Next morning they woke up early because the night before they had slept as soon as it had gotten dark.</p>
<p>"If we had made for the seashore, we might have gotten fish and seashells," one of patients said.</p>
<p>Every member knew that but nobody had suggested it earlier. All of them had abandoned the idea of getting sea food when they decided to go to the mountain.</p>
<p>They didn't have breakfast. After cleaning up the camp site, they loaded the luggage onto the two-wheeled cart and went out to the road.</p>
<p>Then an aftershock hit. As weak ones happened frequently, the members weren't surprised. But this was no ordinary aftershock. All of them grovelled like animals and waited for the sway to calm. A couple of minutes later the sway lulled. And then some people came out of the woods. They seemed to be making for a higher place on the mountain.</p>
<p>"You had better hurry, too," one of the people said.</p>
<p>"Tsunami?" asked Mother.</p>
<p>"I don't know but why risk it?"</p>
<p>"You must be from around here." one of the patients said.</p>
<p>"I have a farm just down from here. When the big earthquake came before, I was in my field. If I hadn't fled to higher ground, I'd have been swallowed by the tide."</p>
<p>"HURRY!" suddenly Larissa cried out, "TSUNAMI IS COMING!"</p>
<p>"Look!" Daniel pointed to the sea.</p>
<p>The tide was rising and coming inland. All the people around started to scurry for a higher spot. The road was getting steeper. Two of the group pulled the cart and three pushed. About five minutes later one of the patients flopped down and two of the members followed.</p>
<p>"I'm exhausted. I've got to take a rest," the patient said.</p>
<p>Then someone shouted, "It's bigger than before!"</p>
<p>"Come on! Move!" one of the nurses told.</p>
<p>"I can't," the patient answered, "You go ahead."</p>
<p>"You'll be swallowed by the tide."</p>
<p>The patient calmed down and said, "Thank you for everything. It's been a good journey."</p>
<p>Another of the three told her, "It's time you left."</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>Then one of the patients from the group took her arm, "Let's go."</p>
<p>"Oh, God!" she cried as she was taken away.</p>
<p>The tsunami was fast approaching the mountain. Five minutes later they stopped at last. Panting heavily, they looked back. Just then the tide reached a level twenty metres below them. The top of the tide became a large wave and hit the slant and broke. The spray attacked them but they were not drawn. The tide stopped there.</p>
<p>Nobody said anything for a few minutes. They lay down on the slope panting. After a few minutes Daniel said to himself, "We are saved but ..."</p>
<p>"We should have brought them," the nurse who tried to help the three said, "We could have-."</p>
<p>Then Larissa said, "It's my fault. If I had told them earlier that the tsunami-."</p>
<p>"No," the patient said, "I'm to blame. If I hadn't taken her arm, she could have save-"</p>
<p>Then Mother sharply cut in, "It's too late to cry."</p>
<p>Everyone went silent. Each of them still felt guilt but realised Mother was right.</p>
<p>She went on in a low voice, "We couldn't do anything for them."</p>
<p>After a short while one of the nurses said, "We better not rest here too long. Just now the tide has begun to ebb, but a second wave may come. Sometimes larger."</p>
<p>They started to walk. Soon many people gathered along the road.</p>
<p>Daniel said, "There are so many people. Where did they come from?"</p>
<p>One of the patients replied, "We didn't notice them because when we reached here, it got dark soon."</p>
<p>After about thirty minutes people began to scatter, and in twos and threes went into the woods. The members of the group looked for a spot to set up camp. Then Larissa noticed a man beckoning to her among the trees.</p>
<p>"Who?" Larissa walked into the woods.</p>
<p>"What's up?" Daniel asked.</p>
<p>But she continued on her way. Daniel followed her and the others followed him. The man was standing in a space like a clearing and a big rucksack lay on the ground next to him.</p>
<p>"Hi, long time no see!" the man said.</p>
<p>"Is that you, Momotaro?"</p>
<p>"That's right. You remember me!"</p>
<p>"Of course!"</p>
<p>The others came to them.</p>
<p>Daniel tried to asked, "Who...oh, Momotaro!"</p>
<p>"Yes, I believed you three would survive."</p>
<p>"How on earth did you get here?"</p>
<p>"I'd like to ask you the same question."</p>
<p>"...oh."</p>
<p>They burst out laughing.</p>
<p>"Anyway stay here." Momotaro said to every member.</p>
<p>Mother said, "I've sometimes thought of you. You were very helpful giving us food that time.</p>
<p>"Oh, never mind. Do you have anything kind of like a rug?"</p>
<p>"We have some blankets."</p>
<p>"OK. Let's spread them out and sit. I have a little present for you."</p>
<p>Some of the members hesitated to stay there.</p>
<p>Larissa said, "You can put your trust in him."</p>
<p>All the members sat on the blankets and Momotaro opened his rucksack.</p>
<p>"You all look hungry. I think you haven't had breakfast. Perhaps you didn't have dinner last night, either."</p>
<p>He produced some potatoes.</p>
<p>"Wow," the people raised their voices.</p>
<p>"Do you have a pan or a pot?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Mother answered, "we have both."</p>
<p>"Good. We can have brunch."</p>
<p>Their tense looks were replaced with smiles. Some of them went to collect firewood and the others started making an oven out of rocks.</p>
<p>"Can I ask something?" Larissa asked Momotaro who stood by her.</p>
<p>"Yes, go ahead." He looked at her.</p>
<p>Daniel and Mother came up to them.</p>
<p>"Did you meet your fiance in Sendai?"</p>
<p>"Uh, I did but I didn't."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"When I was running to her company, I noticed my speed was getting faster ? like a car. But I didn't question it as I was desperate to meet her. The next moment I found myself in the sky. I was flying. I made it to her company but I couldn't find her because the ground floor of the building had been crushed. She must have been on the ground floor as she worked as a reception clerk. I stood for a while. Before long she suddenly came out of the building and approached me. But I sensed something was wrong as soon as I saw her. She didn't look glad or wounded. She stopped a distance away, but she didn't say a word, she just stared at me."</p>
<p>"You asked her something?"</p>
<p>"Of course. I asked 'Are you alive?' but she didn't answer. I started to run up to her, when she faded out like a mist."</p>
<p>All four of them fell silent. The other people put firewood on the oven and built a fire.</p>
<p>"We are deeply grieved at your misfortune," Mother said.</p>
<p>"Thank you."</p>
<p>There were no more words to add. The fire was now flaming.</p>
<p>"Look," Momotaro said, "We still have to wash the potatoes."</p>
<p>Daniel and Larissa replied, "We will do it."</p>
<p>Half an hour later they had brunch. All the members ate the boiled potatoes with smiles on their faces. Larissa and Daniel ate, too, without restraint as they each got an appetite watching the other members eat. That happy time would prove fleeting time for all of them.</p>
<p>After the brunch Momotaro asked, "Would you tell me why you are here?"</p>
<p>"Sure," answered Mother.</p>
<p>She told him about the past events; how they left Sendai, how they stayed in Sapporo, how they lived in Simamaki, what had happened in the hospital and how they arrived at that place. Momotaro kept quiet until after Mother had finished.</p>
<p>Daniel then asked, "Did you fly here?"</p>
<p>"Uh, sometimes ? over the sea and mountains."</p>
<p>"I flew once. When we were in Sapporo."</p>
<p>"I know that."</p>
<p>"What!"</p>
<p>"I saw the scene in my mind ? you and Larissa were flying to the fissure."</p>
<p>"Can you see the past?"</p>
<p>"Sometimes, when I meet a person."</p>
<p>"Huh..."</p>
<p>Momotaro looked at Mother and said, "I'd like to know more about the boy ... uh, who made a tunnel to send you three to Sapporo."</p>
<p>"Oh, Taro. Mm, I don't know much about him. You'd better ask Larissa."</p>
<p>He looked at Larissa.</p>
<p>"I've forgotten Taro," she said, "I haven't met him for some time. He lives in a space ship with a woman. And he comes to see me occasionally, usually before something bad is going to happen. He helps us to avoid danger."</p>
<p>"Who is the woman?"</p>
<p>"Uh, he said she was his friend. But the first time we met, he said she was his mother. I don't know exactly."</p>
<p>"Where are they from?"</p>
<p>"He said he is from the past. He lived in Japan a very long time ago and he met the woman ? oh, her name is Atoa ? she's from ... I can't remember."</p>
<p>"I'd like to meet him if it's possible."</p>
<p>"OK. I'll introduce you to him. I promise."</p>
<p>Then one of the nurses said Momotaro, "I wonder if it's safe around here."</p>
<p>"Don't worry. I made the waves around this place high frequency."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Uh, we call that action pitching Kekkai. Kekkai means something like a fence, although common people can't see it."</p>
<p>"I feel relieved to hear that."</p>
<p>Another nurse said, "I guess it repels things that are ill-intentioned."</p>
<p>"That' right."</p>
<p>Mother said to all of them, "We have to pitch our tents. We can talk again after that."</p>
<p>"Yes," Momotaro replied.</p>
<p>They began the work.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 13</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>Many Christs and Goddesses</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>That night all the members sat around the fire. Momotaro told them about the things he had seen from the sky.</p>
<p>"It looks like almost all of the coastlines facing the Pacific Ocean have sunk. Many millions of people were swallowed by the former tsunami and the millions of survivors have gone inland. Hokkaido was the least affected island in the Japanese archipelago. So I came to Sapporo but since the first earthquake, the situation has changed completely."</p>
<p>"I wonder if Japan will sink into the sea," one of the nurses said.</p>
<p>Another nurse asked to Momotaro, "What's the situation like in other countries?</p>
<p>"As a spirit, I could leave my body, I went to some places but they didn't seem to be any different from Japan, especially the big cities. Most of them had been damaged beyond recognition; New York, Sydney, London, Paris, Moscow, Beijing, the list goes on."</p>
<p>His words filled the members with gloom.</p>
<p>Then Larissa said, "Don't be depressed. It makes us unhappy."</p>
<p>"That's right," Momotaro replied, "Feel joyful, and the conditions will change."</p>
<p>The only surviving patient said, "But it's difficult to feel joyful now."</p>
<p>Momotaro said, "Trust me. Our inner thoughts have great power. What we think comes true."</p>
<p>The patient didn't look convinced.</p>
<p>Momotaro went on, "The reason many people don't notice that fact is that the thoughts don't come true quickly."</p>
<p>Daniel asked, "Does time interfere, then?"</p>
<p>"You have a misunderstanding about time. If all the things you thought of came true quickly, the situations around you would go into confusion. Time prevents this. And with the things you don't want to come true, time works the same way."</p>
<p>"Uh, you mean, what we think from our heart then, has great power?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>One of the nurses said, "How did the world get to be in this state?"</p>
<p>"Through a congruence of thought."</p>
<p>"Do you mean," Daniel said, "Many people longed to get money, their high positions, honour and valuable things ? bags, cars, houses, estates and so on? Provably such selfish thoughts caused this situation in the world."</p>
<p>"That's right. Human beings have lost their bonds with others, nature and Gaea. So the earth has lost its balance because essentially everything is connected."</p>
<p>Then a young woman approached the group.</p>
<p>"Excuse me. Oh, what! I can't move!"</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" asked Mother.</p>
<p>"Why can't I go forward? What is there here?"</p>
<p>Momotaro answered, "There's an invisible fence."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Do you have anything to ask?"</p>
<p>"Yes. My son has a fever. If you have any medicine for a cold, would you give me some? And ... we haven't eaten for two days, so if you have something - ."</p>
<p>"I see. You don't need to say any more." Momotaro stood up.</p>
<p>One of the nurses said, "We have cold medicine."</p>
<p>Momotaro added, "Here are a few potatoes."</p>
<p>The woman suddenly started shedding tears and said, "Thank you very much."</p>
<p>Momotaro walked over and embraced her, "I'll go with you."</p>
<p>The nurse took the medicine and said, "I'll come."</p>
<p>Larissa said soon, "I'll come, too."</p>
<p>"OK. You'll be able to help us."</p>
<p>Daniel said, "I'll go with you, too."</p>
<p>"No. Stay here, Daniel. We need someone to guard the perimeter."</p>
<p>"Oh, OK."</p>
<p>"We'll be back soon," Momotaro said to Mother.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the woman's camp site, a middle aged woman was holding a little boy. She looked like the garndmother.</p>
<p>"These people have offered to help us, mum, and they gave us some potatoes."</p>
<p>"Oh, thank you very much," the middle aged woman said, "My grandson has a high fever."</p>
<p>Momotaro held him up and then laid him down on their blanket. He was wilting.</p>
<p>The nurse touched her hand to the boy's head. "Oh, God," she said in a low voice.</p>
<p>Momotaro stared at Larissa. And then she sat beside the boy. His cheeks were red and his chest was waving slightly. Larissa touched his chest with her hands and then shut her eyes. The mother and the grandmother were watching Larissa, when her body began to brighten gradually. The two women gasped at the white light. It was shaped in an ellipse like a big egg and its colour turned gold.</p>
<p>"Unbelievable!" the mother whispered to the grandma.</p>
<p>Larissa kept still for about five minutes, and then her gold cocoon started expanding and engulfed the boy. Momotaro held out his palms towards Larissa's back. In a little while the boy opened his eyes.</p>
<p>"You're all right now," Larissa said.</p>
<p>"Mummy ...," the boy murmured.</p>
<p>The mother ran up to him, "I'm here. Don't worry."</p>
<p>Larissa stood up and looked at Momotaro.</p>
<p>He said, "You did it, Larissa."</p>
<p>"Yes, but you helped me."</p>
<p>"You are getting stronger. Soon you won't need any help."</p>
<p>Then the mother said, "Thank you. I can't put my gratitude into words."</p>
<p>"You don't have to," Momotaro replied, "You can come and stay with us."</p>
<p>"That would make us very glad," said grandma.</p>
<p>They went back to their camp with the three. The three were warmly welcomed by the other members.</p>
<p>The night came. They had nothing at all to eat. All of the members retired early and tried to sleep. They knew it was one way to avoid feeling hungry. But in the night the little boy sometimes cried with hunger, so they couldn't get much sleep.</p>
<p>Next morning they heard people talking animatedly from the other camps. Two of the nurses and Daniel went out to listen. After a while they came back.</p>
<p>"They say there's a man who says he is Christ. He has handed out rice and vegetables to many people," one of the nurses spoke in haste.</p>
<p>The other nurse said, "They say it must be the Second Advent."</p>
<p>"Be careful!" Momotaro replied.</p>
<p>"What!" the two nurses asked.</p>
<p>"Christ will never come again. This guy can't be Christ. If you want Christ, you have to be Christlike"</p>
<p>"We can't be Christs."</p>
<p>"Of course you can. Larissa's becoming so, and Daniel, too."</p>
<p>"So how can we be Christs?"</p>
<p>"I know." said Daniel then, "You clear your soul. Desire nothing for yourself and act for others."</p>
<p>"But ..." the nurse was silent.</p>
<p>Then the mother who came yesterday asked the nurse, "Would you tell me where the Christ is?"</p>
<p>"You're going?" Daniel asked her.</p>
<p>"My son is starving ... my mother and I will starve in time, too."</p>
<p>"No!" Larissa said, "You shouldn't go. As long as you stay here you won't die of hunger. Trust me."</p>
<p>"Sorry, but we can't bear the hunger any more. We'll be back soon with some food."</p>
<p>Eventually the mother and the grandmother with the little boy and the two nurses went out. The other members who remained were only six; Larissa, Daniel, their mother, Momotaro, the remaining nurse and the last patient.</p>
<p>The night came. None of the members who went out had returned. The night was stiller than the last. There„ÄÄwere no voices or crying. All of the members lay on their blankets. They looked like they were thinking about the other members who had left, but no one said anything.</p>
<p>It was midnight.„ÄÄA sound like footsteps approached the camp. Momotaro noticed it first. He sat up and strained his ears for the sound.</p>
<p>Larissa next sat up and shouted, "That's Taro!"</p>
<p>Her voice woke the other members.</p>
<p>"Hi, Larissa. How have you been?"</p>
<p>"I've been fine. I have a lot of things to tell you."</p>
<p>"OK, but would you raise this barrier?"</p>
<p>"Oh, sorry." She turned to Momotaro. "Would you let him in?"</p>
<p>"Off course." He stretched out his arm from the front of his chest and made the sign of the X, and then he said, "Come in, please."</p>
<p>"Nice to meet you," said Taro.</p>
<p>"Nice to meet you, too," Momotaro replied, "I've been looking forward to meeting you."</p>
<p>"I'm glad to see you." Taro replied, "I've been watching you, on and off for awhile. Your potential is gradually unfolding."</p>
<p>"Oh, from the sky?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Not only you, but other people who have opened their eyes to their abilities."</p>
<p>Momotaro replied, "There are some people who mistake themselves for the Saviours, though."</p>
<p>"I watched the scene. It was a pity some members of your group followed one of them," and Taro added, "Sorry, but I have to listen to Larissa.</p>
<p>"OK. No problem."</p>
<p>Taro took her hand and shut his eyes, "Give me what you want to tell me."</p>
<p>Larissa also shut her eyes. The two stayed still for about a minute. All the other members just stared.</p>
<p>Taro opened his eyes first, "I see, Larissa. A lot has happened and you've had many trying experiences."</p>
<p>"Now there's another big difficulty. Most of the people around here are starving."</p>
<p>"I know, Larissa. Your members, too. So ... I came with my ... my friend."</p>
<p>"Your friend? ... perhaps that is Atoa?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>Then behind Taro a lovely lady emerged from the darkness. She was sending out golden brightness, and around her head there was shining aureole.</p>
<p>"Nice to meet you, everyone," she said in a soft clear voice.</p>
<p>But nobody said anything in reply as they were fascinated by her beauty.</p>
<p>"Nice to meet you, too," Larissa said at last, "I've often heard about you from Taro."</p>
<p>"But it's not our first time we meet now. We've known each other before you were born."</p>
<p>"Oh, great!"</p>
<p>"You will recollect our meetings and conversations."</p>
<p>"I'm looking forward to doing so."</p>
<p>Atoa looked at Mother. "I know your responsibilities have increased since your husband went to the other world. But he always keeps an eye on you and the children."</p>
<p>Mother's eyes were filled with tears.</p>
<p>Atoa went on, "He is here now. I can ask instead of you if you have anything to ask."</p>
<p>"Uh, I want to know his condition ... and whether we have a chance to meet again."</p>
<p>Atoa watched the void for a while and turned back towards her.</p>
<p>"He says he is now in a peaceful world filled with light, so you don't have to worry about him. And ... he and you will meet again soon."</p>
<p>"I see."</p>
<p>"Indeed the reason I came here is that he asked me to help you all."</p>
<p>"How can you help us?"</p>
<p>Atoa raised her hand in front of Mother's head and aimed her palm towards Mother's forehead. Then the gold light started to engulf Mother. All of the other members goggled in surprise.</p>
<p>After a few minutes she put down her hand and said, "Now, you won't need to eat any food for a while."</p>
<p>Atoa did it to the nurse and the patient, too.</p>
<p>Then Larissa asked, "Would you tell me, Atoa, can human beings survive?"</p>
<p>"Now the earth intends to rejuvenate herself. Most people on the earth have forgotten that she has given them life. In doing so they have tormented her. So the earth is going to sweep away people except the ones linked to her. If you find you are part of the earth and if you polish your soul until it shines, you will be protected no matter what."</p>
<p>Daniel asked, "Would you tell me that more concretely?"</p>
<p>"Give anything to those who have no malice. The earth has given you everything ? your body, your clothes, your house, your food, many beautiful things, many comfortable sounds ? these are all blessings from the earth. It is most important to oblige her."</p>
<p>Then Momotaro said, "I feel I've met you before."</p>
<p>"You have recollected your pre-existence."</p>
<p>"I have?"</p>
<p>Atoa was silent.</p>
<p>Momotaro said excitedly, "It was a very long time ago."</p>
<p>"Yes," Atoa replied, "Momotaro, long long time no see. We meet after an interval of two billion years."</p>
<p>"Two billion years?"</p>
<p>"Yes. You were my father then."</p>
<p>Momotaro could feel a mass of information flowing from her.</p>
<p>"I can see, I can see the many scenes we lived."</p>
<p>"Your soul has evolved. The countless experiences you see are from your many other lives."</p>
<p>Daniel said, "So there was a reason why he became able to fly."</p>
<p>"That's right," Atoa replied, "It was not a sudden event. This time he was born to redeem many people."</p>
<p>"Excuse me," then the nurse said, "uh, can't we just go in your space ship?"</p>
<p>"It's possible, of course, but if you do, you won't be able to overcome your Karma. Your Karma is linked to the earth. The earth has given your flesh and blood, and you have lived many times with the earth, so if you flee the earth, you will lose the chance to settle your Karma."</p>
<p>"I see, but this situation is too hard."</p>
<p>"You have to realise this is a trial. The earth is going to realign, affecting every creature and plant. On the new earth only humans who have cleared their souls will survive."</p>
<p>"OK, I trust you."</p>
<p>"I know you have perseverance and endeavour. This is all you will need."</p>
<p>"For what?"</p>
<p>"To become a new human being. When you are, your body won't get any illnesses or injuries, and your brain will work ten or twenty times faster, and your body will have a good form. In addition you will be able to fly anywhere and to move long distances in an instant."</p>
<p>Then the patient asked, "So we'll never need to eat when we are new human beings?"</p>
<p>"No, but if you want, you can eat food. The energy you require will well out of the inside of your body. Larissa, Daniel and Momotaro have already reached this stage."</p>
<p>Mother said, "Anyway, let's sit and have some tea."</p>
<p>"Thank you," Atoa replied, "but I don't have a lot of time. Do you have anything like a pot?"</p>
<p>"Er, we have a kettle."</p>
<p>"That'll do. Would you bring it to me?"</p>
<p>The nurse said, "OK." She brought it and added, "There's water in it."</p>
<p>Atoa took it and touch the side of it for several seconds.</p>
<p>"It's been sometime since you've had coffee. Get your cups."</p>
<p>Each of them brought their cup and held it out. Atoa tilted the kettle and out came steaming coffee."</p>
<p>"Wow," Daniel said, "she's really like a Christ."</p>
<p>"If only I were."</p>
<p>The members sipped the coffee. Atoa sat on the grass as she watched them drink.</p>
<p>Mother said, "Sit on this carpet, please."</p>
<p>"Thank you, but I don't need that. My body and clothes cannot get dirty."</p>
<p>"Really?" Daniel asked.</p>
<p>"No, because such thoughts never enter my heart. All thoughts and ideas come true soon in the spiritual world. But in this world things come true slowly. If you think something from the bottom of your heart, it will come true soon even in this world."</p>
<p>The patient asked, "Would you tell me what the situation is in the rest of the world?"</p>
<p>"You don't have to know about things like that, because you have to face your own situation. That is your obligation. But I'll tell you a little."</p>
<p>Atoa took a sip of coffee and went on, "A moment ago Daniel said I was like Christ. Many men who claim to be Christ are appearing all over the world. And there are many women who claim to be the Virgin Mary. In Japan people are coming out and saying they are gods or goddesses. Some of the names you will hear are Susano, Amaterasu, Miroku bosatu, Dainichi nyorai, Amida nyorai."</p>
<p>Mother said, "Some of our members went with one of them."</p>
<p>"You must not believe them. You can all be like real gods and goddesses, because you are parts of the Universe, and the Universe is God."</p>
<p>The nurse asked another question, "Would you tell me how my parents and my brother are? I've tried reaching them since the earthquake occurred, but I haven't been able to."</p>
<p>"Sadly, they are no longer in this world. But you will meet them in the near future."</p>
<p>"Near future?"</p>
<p>"I don't mean you'll leave this world soon. Trust me. I can't say any more."</p>
<p>And the patient asked, too, "My wife was at the hospital when the earthquake occurred. She was waiting on the ground floor. She was going to pay my hospital bill because I was leaving that day. I haven't seen her since."</p>
<p>"You may think she was unfortunate but that was her destiny. She left this world in order to give you a trial. That was to see whether you could survive this situation without her."</p>
<p>"Oh," he said in a low voice.</p>
<p>Atoa went on, "But her disappearance led you out of the hospital. After you left, the people in the hospital all died in the second tsunami."</p>
<p>"Oh, God!" all the members uttered.</p>
<p>"Atoa," Larissa said, "I wonder if I can become a woman like you."</p>
<p>"Believe in yourself. You'll never be someone you don't want to be."</p>
<p>Larissa nodded slightly, and Atoa stood up.</p>
<p>"Now I have to leave."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Atoa," said Momotaro, "I believe we'll be able to meet, again."</p>
<p>"I believe it, too."</p>
<p>The other members thanked her, too.</p>
<p>She said at last, "If you resolve your Karma, everybody, I will invite you to my space ship."</p>
<p>Taro and Atoa faded away into the darkness.</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>

<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>CHAPTER ÔºëÔºî„ÄÄ</p>
<p>The Aurora</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>Since the people had already picked everything to eat on Mt. Teine, there had hardly been wild any grapes, mushrooms, berries or anything of the kind.</p>
<p>The members of the group could spend three days without food by the grace of Atoa. So they had forgotten to collect food.</p>
<p>Daniel asked Momotaro, "Where did you get the potatoes?"</p>
<p>"On the way here I rescued a boy under some dirt. He was buried when the aftershock struck."</p>
<p>"Which one?"</p>
<p>"After the earthquake you ran up against in Sendai."</p>
<p>"Oh, you came here after that."</p>
<p>"Yes. I took him to his house, and his mother gave me some potatoes in gratitude." "I see. Do you remember where the house is?"</p>
<p>"Of course."</p>
<p>"Would you come with me to the house? I'll ask his mother to give us some food."</p>
<p>Momotaro looked at Daniel and said, "OK, let's do it."</p>
<p>They told the other members they were going to the foot of the mountain to look for food, and left.</p>
<p>After they had walked for an hour, Daniel asked Momotaro, "Why can't I fly whenever I want to?"</p>
<p>"Well, you can. If you think about it from the bottom of your heart."</p>
<p>"Is that all?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Why don't you trust me?"</p>
<p>"I do. It just ..."</p>
<p>"I know you really want to fly. But don't be tied to your wish."</p>
<p>„ÄÄDaniel fell silent.</p>
<p>"OK, let's give it a try," Momotaro took his hand.</p>
<p>Suddenly Daniel felt his body float in the air.</p>
<p>"I see, Momotaro. I did trust you, but this is not due to my ability."</p>
<p>"Yes, it is. If you didn't have the ability, even I couldn't make you fly."</p>
<p>The two were flying over the forest and headed for the foot of the mountain. They circled above some fields and found the boy's house. But it looked like a ruin.</p>
<p>"The family might have abandoned the house," Daniel said.</p>
<p>The two landed in front of the house.</p>
<p>"You had better not come in," said Momotaro and entered the house.</p>
<p>„ÄÄAfter a while he came out, but he didn't say anything.</p>
<p>"Is anyone there?" Daniel asked.</p>
<p>Momotaro answered, "You'd better not go in."</p>
<p>Daniel stared at Taro. "Oh."</p>
<p>There was a short silence between them, and Momotaro said, "The boy and his mother are saying we can take vegetables from their field if anything left."</p>
<p>„ÄÄDaniel surprisingly said, "I can hear that, too!"</p>
<p>"So, let's get some, then."</p>
<p>„ÄÄThey went to the field behind the house.</p>
<p>"That's a Japanese radish!" Daniel shouted and ran to the white thing sticking out of the ground. He gripped it and pulled with all his strength.</p>
<p>"I did it!" He held it up and smiled.</p>
<p>Momotaro smiled back and said, "Would you pull out some more? I'll dig out some potatoes."</p>
<p>"OK," Daniel replied.</p>
<p>„ÄÄ The two silently did their own jobs and piled up radishes and potatoes.</p>
<p>"How are we going to take all these back?" Daniel asked.</p>
<p>"I don't know. What do you think?"</p>
<p>"Oh, God." Daniel got silent.</p>
<p>"We need help. Would you try to reach someone?"</p>
<p>"Someone?„ÄÄEr, you mean someone in our group?"</p>
<p>"That's right. You can do it."</p>
<p>„ÄÄDaniel pictured himself talking to Larissa. And he felt she was telling him something.</p>
<p>'What?„ÄÄYou are coming?' he mumbled, 'How did you know we needed help?'</p>
<p>„ÄÄThen Momotaro told him, 'The truth is I communicated with her when I was digging for the potatoes.'</p>
<p>'Really?'</p>
<p>'Yes. I asked her to bring us the cart. Would you tell her the way from the main road?'</p>
<p>'Ah, OK.'</p>
<p>„ÄÄHe communicated with her and told Momotaro, "Larissa said all of the members except for the patient are coming."</p>
<p>"OK, good."</p>
<p>„ÄÄAfter about twenty minutes they arrived. Daniel went to greet them. They had with them the two-wheeled cart. They looked happy.</p>
<p>"Mum, you can have dinner today!"</p>
<p>"Thank you, Daniel. But I think I can endure today."</p>
<p>Then Momotaro came over. "Would you help us load the vegetables?"</p>
<p>"Of course," the other members replied.</p>
<p>They finished the loading and left for their camp. The sun was sinking and a cold wind started to blow. They walked for an hour and it was getting dark.</p>
<p>"Look!" the nurse shouted as she pointed at the sky.</p>
<p>"Wow," the other members exclaimed, "Aurora !"</p>
<p>She said, "How beautiful! I've never seen it before.</p>
<p>The blue aurora was shining as it wavered and flew like a flag.</p>
<p>"But I have a bad feeling about this," Mother said.</p>
<p>„ÄÄAll the other people stared at her.</p>
<p>"After all," she went on, "Sapporo is located forty three degrees north."</p>
<p>„ÄÄDaniel said, "The solar wind is strengthening. But ... why?"</p>
<p>"I think the solar activity is accelerating," Momotaro said, "Maybe the solar system is changing."</p>
<p>"In what way?" Daniel asked.</p>
<p>"It's too soon to say. But whatever happens we'll need to pass through it."</p>
<p>"Auroras are usually only seen in polar regions," Daniel said, "Perhaps ..."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" Larissa asked.</p>
<p>"The earth's axis might have moved."</p>
<p>"But if it had moved," Momotaro cut in, "we would have seen the sun move to another orbit."</p>
<p>"Oh, that's right."</p>
<p>„ÄÄAll of them went silent and kept walking. As they approached their camp, it happened.</p>
<p>"Look!" Larissa shouted. She pointed at the moon, "It's sliding!"</p>
<p>All the members turned pale in an instant with awful fear.</p>
<p>"Wha, what is happening?" at last Daniel mumbled.</p>
<p>Momotaro shouted, "Hurry!"</p>
<p>They started running to the camp, but it was slow going with the cart. When they finally arrived there, the patient told them, "All the stars have gone!"</p>
<p>The other members looked up at the sky. There was just a shroud of darkness.</p>
<p>It was like the cloak of the Devil. Following the moon and stars, the mountains, trees and bushes all faded out. And at last the grass, the ground and their faces perished.</p>
<p>"Mummy, I can't see you," Larissa cried, "Grip my hand!"</p>
<p>It was jet-black.</p>
<p>"What is this?" Daniel yelled.</p>
<p>Some cries went up here and there around the camp. Momotaro remembered he had read about this before in some books. There was a real darkness which could absorb any ray. Reports about it were recorded in the histories of some countries. They were really horrible events.„ÄÄPeople couldn't see each other's faces. In one report it lasted for hours, but in others for days.</p>
<p>„ÄÄAll of the members crept and felt their way into the Kekkai. The patient took out an electric torch and turned it on. He looked at the light for a second, but then it disappeared.</p>
<p>"Oh, God," he said.</p>
<p>But he didn't give up. He took a candle out of his pocket and lit it. This time he couldn't see the flame even for a second. So he held his hand out above the point where the flame would be.</p>
<p>"Ouch! It's burning! Why can't we see it?"</p>
<p>„ÄÄAll the members except for Momotaro began trembling.</p>
<p>"Calm down." Momotaro said," Let's hold each other's hands."</p>
<p>„ÄÄAnd he told them how he had read about similar events. They seemed to be persuaded, but their fear wasn't swept away.</p>
<p>"We can't do anything," said Mother.</p>
<p>„ÄÄThey kept silent for a while and the patient said, "I want to know why the moon moved quickly."</p>
<p>"As Daniel has suspected," Momotaro replied, "The earth's axis has inclined to in another direction."</p>
<p>"I feel something dreadful will happen," the nurse said to herself.</p>
<p>They waited for the jet-black darkness to leave. But even after one hour it was still pitch black.</p>
<p>„ÄÄAt last Mother said in an undertone, "There's nothing that we can do but sleep."</p>
<p>At that moment the earth started shaking heavily. It was a horrible tremor nobody had ever met with. When humankind is attacked by real fear, no one can utter any words. In the beginning the ground oscillated up and down, and then side to side. They couldn't stand or sit, or even crawl. They were grovelling for a long time, until they tumbled about on the ground. They became separated. And all the members heard a sound something like big rocks rolling towards them. Some of the rocks seemed to bump against the trees.</p>
<p>"Help!" at last the nurse cried in the heat of fear that she would die.</p>
<p>"Take my hand!" Momotaro said to her.</p>
<p>"Where are you?"</p>
<p>"Here!"</p>
<p>"I can't move! Come back to me!"</p>
<p>Momotaro tried to creep up to where her voice came from. But he couldn't approach her as he was overturned again and again. The next moment they heard a great thud. They didn't understand what had happened, but it became clear when a blast of wind attacked them. A nearby tree fell down.</p>
<p>„ÄÄThe jolts were getting more violent. Their bodies jumped up and down on the waves of the ground like people on a trampoline. The circle of them broke up. And many trees around them fell down one after another.</p>
<p>„ÄÄThe members were rolled over again and again, they couldn't see anything, their arms and legs didn't function. They really felt the earth would break and that the world would end soon. It continued for another ten minutes. They couldn't stand all these events and they were almost in a stupor.</p>
<p>Then salvation suddenly came. The tremor went away. But there was still the rolling of the stones and the crashing sound they made when they hit the trees. After a while all of the noise ceased.</p>
<p>Daniel survived. He felt that the silence was like an awful creature. It spread all over the mountain.</p>
<p>"Too silent," Daniel mumbled.</p>
<p>„ÄÄHe didn't hear one word around him. Even if there were other people who had survived, they must be exhausted.</p>
<p>„ÄÄThen a voice went up, "Anyone there?"</p>
<p>It was Momotaro.</p>
<p>"I'm here!" Daniel answered.</p>
<p>Then another voice went up. "Help, Daniel!" it was Larissa's voice.</p>
<p>"Where are you?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Here! I'm in a ditch. I can't move!"</p>
<p>Her voice came from lower down. Daniel crept towards the voice.</p>
<p>"No. More to your left." Larissa told.</p>
<p>"Can you see me?"</p>
<p>"Wow! I can just make you out."</p>
<p>„ÄÄThen someone abruptly grasped Daniel's arm.</p>
<p>"It's me."</p>
<p>"Oh, Momotaro! Can you see, too?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I just started to then, but not with my eyes."</p>
<p>"You can see with your feelings?"</p>
<p>"I'm sure the image directly comes to my brain or to my spirit. Anyway we have to rescue her."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>„ÄÄThe two reached Larissa. She had fallen into a ditch and was covered in pebbles. Momotaro asked as he swept the pebbles aside, "Are you injured?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. I can't see clearly."</p>
<p>„ÄÄLarissa got up and suddenly felt petrified. She began trembling. "It will come," she mumbled in a low voice.</p>
<p>"What will come?" Daniel asked.</p>
<p>"Mummy, mummy! Where are you?"</p>
<p>"What will come?" Daniel asked again.</p>
<p>"Tsunami, huge tsunami will come soon!"</p>
<p>"OK," Momotaro replied, "We have to flee to a higher place."</p>
<p>"No, it must be the top of the mountain!"</p>
<p>„ÄÄDaniel said, "That's impossible. We'll never reach it in time."</p>
<p>"Don't quibble. Look for Mummy."</p>
<p>"But I can't see anything."</p>
<p>„ÄÄLarissa and Momotaro began to search.</p>
<p>"Mummy! Where are you?" she called out desperately. Again and again.</p>
<p>„ÄÄMomotaro called out for the nurse and the patient. Before long there was a voice near Daniel.</p>
<p>"I'm here."</p>
<p>"Is it you, nurse?" Daniel asked. It seemed like the nurse's voice.</p>
<p>"Momotaro, come here, please! I found the nurse!"</p>
<p>The voice asked, "Daniel, where are you?"</p>
<p>"I'm here." he answered.</p>
<p>The nurse seemed to creep up on him. "You can call me Ayako. We know each other well now."</p>
<p>Momotaro came soon. "Oh, are you OK?"</p>
<p>"I'm OK. I was just afraid of the tremor and the thuds in the darkness."</p>
<p>"Daniel, would you grasp her hand?" Momotaro asked.</p>
<p>"OK."</p>
<p>Momotaro led her to Daniel and asked her, "Do you know where is ... I don't remember his name, the patient?"</p>
<p>"Ah, I think he probably died."</p>
<p>"Died!" Daniel yelled, "How do you know that?"</p>
<p>"After we tumbled I could feel his hand, so I gripped it. But I could tell a big rock was rolling towards us. And there was a thud. Then he let go of my hand"</p>
<p>"Oh, God."</p>
<p>"I see," Momotaro said, "Now we have to find Mother. Stay here." He left them.</p>
<p>Momotaro searched in the opposite direction to Larissa. And found something.</p>
<p>"OH, my God. Oh, my God!"</p>
<p>It was Mother. Then Larissa came up to him. Momotaro quickly stood in her way.</p>
<p>"Did you find someone?" Larissa asked him as she hurried over.</p>
<p>Momotaro cried out, "Stay back!"</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>Suddenly Momotaro hugged her face in his stomach.</p>
<p>"Don't look, Larissa. She's gone."</p>
<p>"Mummy? You mean Mummy?"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Larissa."</p>
<p>"OH, MUMMY!" she cried out loudly and became delirious.</p>
<p>He picked her up and carried back to Daniel. The two felt something was wrong.</p>
<p>"Larissa, what's the matter?" Daniel asked.</p>
<p>She just sobbed bitterly. Daniel shuddered. He dreaded what Momotaro would say next. Rather than wait, he made up his mind to ask him himself, with courage.</p>
<p>"Mo, Mo...Mother?"</p>
<p>„ÄÄBut the word wouldn't come out of Momotaro. Daniel stared at him.</p>
<p>Momotaro said at last, "She went quickly."</p>
<p>"No, I don't believe such a thing."</p>
<p>"Daniel, you ?."</p>
<p>"NO! I DON'T BELIEVE IT!"</p>
<p>He dissolved into tears. The cries of the sister and the brother sounded in the darkness. The nurse sobbed in sympathy. But they knew there wasn't much time for them.</p>
<p>"Tsunami...," after a while Larissa said as she sobbed, "is coming."</p>
<p>„ÄÄMomotaro brought them back to reality.</p>
<p>"We have to flee to the top of the mountain right now."</p>
<p>"Yes," the nurse replied, "let's leave for the tiptop."</p>
<p>They started. Momotaro led the way with Larissa in his arms, Daniel held Momotaro's waistband from behind and the nurse held Daniel's jacket as she followed him. It took about five minutes to find the main road to the tiptop. The fear that they wouldn't make it heightened in their minds.</p>
<p>"We have to run." the nurse said. Her anxiety had come to a peak.</p>
<p>„ÄÄMomotaro sped up. Ten minutes later they lost their breath.</p>
<p>"I wonder if we will be in time," Daniel said.</p>
<p>"How far is it to the tiptop?" the nurse asked.</p>
<p>No one answered.</p>
<p>"Do you know, Momotaro?" she asked again.</p>
<p>"I don't know exactly ... maybe about five kilometres."</p>
<p>"Oh, God." Larissa said, "We won't be in time. The tsunami is coming just around the corner."</p>
<p>"Yes." Momotaro suddenly stopped and said, "We don't have to hurry now. There's no way to do it."</p>
<p>„ÄÄAll of them sat down. They were panting except for Larissa.</p>
<p>The nurse said, "That's it. This is where it ends."</p>
<p>They were struck silent.</p>
<p>„ÄÄAfter a while the nurse said again, "You three can fly anywhere. Go to a safe place. I'm prepared for my death. Thank you very much for -."</p>
<p>"Wait," Daniel cut in, "Momotaro may be able to fly with you." And Daniel looked at him.</p>
<p>"I don't know I can fly in this darkness," Momotaro replied, "This darkness is different from usual."</p>
<p>"Oh, that's right."</p>
<p>"I don't know if I can fly, either." said Larissa.</p>
<p>They fell silent again.</p>
<p>Soon Momotaro said, "I'll try." He stood up.</p>
<p>Larissa watched him fly away. They waited for him to return. At that time they heard an ominous noise. They all turned pale. They knew what it meant. It was like a groan that hell had uttered. Then they heard a thud nearby.</p>
<p>"That's Momotaro!" Larissa shouted. She led Daniel and the nurse and went to the point of the thud. She found him.</p>
<p>"Are you OK?" asked Larissa.</p>
<p>"No, I can't move."</p>
<p>Daniel said to the nurse, "Ayako, see to him, please!"</p>
<p>„ÄÄShe stretched her arms and touched his legs.</p>
<p>"OUCH!" Momotaro yelled.</p>
<p>"How is he, Ayako?" Larissa asked.</p>
<p>"I think his leg is broken."</p>
<p>The groan from hell grew louder and louder.</p>
<p>"I'll try to cure him," said Larissa.</p>
<p>"There's no time!" the nurse barked.</p>
<p>„ÄÄBut Larissa softly touched his leg and shut her eyes. The rumbling of the earth was getting violent.</p>
<p>Larissa opened her eyes, "I can't concentrate."</p>
<p>„ÄÄDaniel said„ÄÄin a low voice, "That's it."</p>
<p>They prepared themselves for death.</p>
<p>Larissa calmly said, "Thank you, Momotaro. Thank you, Daniel. Thank you, Ayako. I'll never forget all the things you've done for me."</p>
<p>"It's me who has to say 'thank you'." The nurse said.</p>
<p>"No, it's me. I have been a pain at times. Sorry and thank you for everything," said Daniel.</p>
<p>„ÄÄMomotaro followed them, "I'm very sorry that I couldn't rescue you guys."</p>
<p>"No, you are not to blame," the other three replied.</p>
<p>They got silent. They took each other's hands and waited for the end. The huge tsunami had swallowed the plain and now ran up the side of Mt. Teine.</p>
<p>„ÄÄThen someone touched Larissa's shoulder.</p>
<p>"Who's that?" she looked back.</p>
<p>"It's me." a voice said.</p>
<p>"Oh, is that you, Taro?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Everybody, hurry! Come with me."</p>
<p>"Where are we going?"</p>
<p>"To my space ship. The landing vehicle is over there."</p>
<p>"Is it OK?" Daniel asked.</p>
<p>"Of course. I'll lead you. Let's go."</p>
<p>They stood up but not Momotaro. He could only lie there.</p>
<p>"Taro," the nurse said, "His leg is broken. He can't walk."</p>
<p>"I know." Taro turned to him and said, "Don't worry. We'll come back for you."</p>
<p>They walked away in a line. After about twenty metres Taro stopped.</p>
<p>"Here it is," he said. And he took a small control board and pushed one of the buttons.</p>
<p>„ÄÄThe next moment they were in the landing vehicle.</p>
<p>"Wow!" they cried in admiration. They could see everything around them. They felt it had been a very long time since they were able to see.</p>
<p>„ÄÄTaro made the ship move and stop above Momotaro. From the underside of the ship a light tube extended to the ground and covered Momotaro. The next moment his body floated up along the light tube. The huge tsunami was getting closer.</p>
<p>"The tsunami!" Daniel cried as he looked at a screen set up on a wall.</p>
<p>Everyone watched the screen. The tsunami was surging towards them. The next moment the tsunami broke against the vehicle.</p>
<p>"Taro, get us out of here!" Daniel yelled, just as the screen went black.</p>
<p>"Oh, my God!" They cried out and lay down.</p>
<p>But strangely the impact didn't come. They slowly lifted their heads. Momotaro lay on the floor. He looked unconscious.</p>
<p>Taro smiled and said, "This vehicle isn't under the influence of the three-dimensional world."</p>
<p>"Why not?" asked Daniel.</p>
<p>"This ship isn't in the three dimensions. We are now in the different ones."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" Ayako asked.</p>
<p>"Your world....I mean your dimension falls on a different one."</p>
<p>She asked again, "It means there are two dimensions in the same space?"</p>
<p>"Yes, that's right. Anyway we have to go to the mother-ship."</p>
<p>Taro touched a panel fixed on the desk in front of him. Ayako went up to Momotaro. But he didn't move at all.</p>
<p>Taro said, "As soon as we arrive at the mother-ship, he will be operated on."</p>
<p>"Where did the windows come from?" Daniel asked.</p>
<p>They could see a starlit sky through the windows.</p>
<p>"I just opened them now," answered Taro.</p>
<p>Larissa stepped up to a window and said, "The stars are not so bright."</p>
<p>"That's because there is no air outside." Taro replied.</p>
<p>"Stars don't twinkle in a vacuum?"</p>
<p>"No, Larissa. And the sun and the moon look smaller."</p>
<p>"Oh, the small sun!" Daniel said as he looked through another window, "Come here, Larissa. Have a look!"</p>
<p>„ÄÄLarissa ran up to him.</p>
<p>Ayako said to them, "You mustn't look at the sun directly. It's bad for your eyes."</p>
<p>"No problem," said Taro, "The windows are made of special glass."</p>
<p>In a second they were beside the mother-ship. It looked enormous.</p>
<p>"Is that really the mother-ship?" Ayako asked.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"It's too large to be a space-ship."</p>
<p>The landing vehicle approached the enormous ship.</p>
<p>"We are moving slowly now," Daniel said to himself.</p>
<p>„ÄÄTaro smiled and said, "We are now going at five thousand kilometres an hour."</p>
<p>"What!"</p>
<p>"It looks slow because the mother-ship is very large."</p>
<p>Suddenly someone screamed.</p>
<p>"Wow!" it was Momotaro.</p>
<p>Ayako asked a little guiltily, "Are you OK?"</p>
<p>"I'm in a lot of pain."</p>
<p>„ÄÄGreasy sweat floated on his face.</p>
<p>"I have some anodynes."</p>
<p>She felt about in her pocket.</p>
<p>"Don't give him that," Taro said.</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>He held out a blue capsule and said, "Give him this. Your medicines will only harm his body."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"They work well in the short term, but in the long run they just poison."</p>
<p>"Really?" she asked with a puzzled expression.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid so. All of the medicines on the earth are the same."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>Then Larissa asked Taro, "Is that the entrance?"</p>
<p>"Yes." Taro said as he guided the craft towards a huge opening.</p>
<p>„ÄÄThe landing vehicle went into the entrance.</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>

<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>CHAPTER 15</p>
<p>The Relief</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>It was an astonishing view. When they went out of the landing-vehicle, they didn't feel they were inside a spaceship. Instead of a floor there was ground under neath them. It was an extensive space.</p>
<p>"Are those really woods?" Daniel asked surprisingly.</p>
<p>"Yes. There are streams, too." Taro answered.</p>
<p>The three of them ? Daniel, Larissa and Ayako ? just stood in utter amazement. Then some people came out of the woods.</p>
<p>"Isn't it only Atoa or you who stay here?" Larissa asked.</p>
<p>"They are people we rescued."</p>
<p>"But," Ayako asked, "Even though this space ship is huge, isn't it impossible to accommodate all the people in Japan or in the world?"</p>
<p>"Of course. They are particular people."</p>
<p>"Particular?" Ayako asked again.</p>
<p>"Yes, they have high undulation."</p>
<p>"Undulation? What is that?"</p>
<p>"Ur...."</p>
<p>Before Taro could answer, the people said to them, "Welcome. We surely suppose you've had many bitter experiences. But you can heal your souls here."</p>
<p>„ÄÄAyako looked at Taro, and he smiled. He hinted to her to go and to talk to them. Then Taro left for Momotaro.</p>
<p>"I thought it was only us who were rescued. I wonder if Taro and Atoa have some companions. You are their companions?"</p>
<p>"No, we are not. There are no companions here. We've thought it was only us to have come here, too."</p>
<p>"Are there other groups here, then?"</p>
<p>"Yes. But most people here are on their own."</p>
<p>Then another woman said, "I guess you are hungry. Come with us, and you will have much food."</p>
<p>"Great!" Daniel yelled.</p>
<p>The three followed them. The place where they stopped didn't look like a camp.</p>
<p>"Here?" Daniel asked.</p>
<p>"Yes. We'll soon prepare some dishes." the woman answered.</p>
<p>"But...there's no tent or table."</p>
<p>"Here everything appears when you need it."</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Now that you are here, you don't have to worry about anything."</p>
<p>„ÄÄThen some other people brought the food.</p>
<p>"Come on, let's all sit on the ground."</p>
<p>"But...there's still no table."</p>
<p>And an old man next to the woman said, "You don't need one. So it doesn't appear."</p>
<p>"Don't need it?"</p>
<p>"No, you can eat the dishes without a table."</p>
<p>Ayako said, "That's true," and looked at Daniel, "Sit down, Daniel."</p>
<p>"Please, help yourselves," the woman said.</p>
<p>"Itadakimas," the old man said as Daniel stretched his hand out to grab some food.</p>
<p>"Oh, I nearly forgot," and he added, "Itadakimas."</p>
<p>"You are Japanese," the old man said, "Don't just say the word, Daniel. Mean it from the bottom of your heart."</p>
<p>"OK. I will certainly do it like that from now on."</p>
<p>"You know. We owe our lives to all of the creatures in the universe."</p>
<p>They started eating but Larissa just sat.</p>
<p>"Why don't you eat?" asked Ayako.</p>
<p>Larissa didn't answer and suddenly wept bitterly.</p>
<p>"What's the matter?"</p>
<p>But she didn't say anything. That reminded Daniel and Ayako ? she hadn't spoken so much since her mother died.</p>
<p>Daniel said, "Tell us if there is anything you want."</p>
<p>At last she said, "Please take me to Atoa."</p>
<p>Just as the woman was going to take her, a graceful woman emerged from the trees.</p>
<p>"Atoa is coming," the woman said.</p>
<p>Daniel said surprisingly, "As if she heard us."</p>
<p>The old man said, "She knows when she is needed."</p>
<p>As soon as Atoa got to them, she embraced Larissa.</p>
<p>"You have something to ask me?"</p>
<p>„ÄÄTears welled up in Larissa's eyes again.</p>
<p>"Why didn't you come to us earlier to rescue us? You must have been able to. If you had, Mummy would still be alive."</p>
<p>Atoa gently said, "Your mother had to go to your father. It was the destiny Heaven provided."</p>
<p>"But...but I don't understand." She sobbed convulsively.</p>
<p>"Calm down, Larissa. Would you listen to me carefully?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>Daniel was gazing at the two. His eyes were full of tears.</p>
<p>"You have things to attend to," Atoa went on, "from before you were born. Use your imagination. You will remember your pledge."</p>
<p>„ÄÄAfter a little while Larissa replied, "Oh, I see. I see that. I have to help many people to open the eyes in their minds."</p>
<p>"That's right, Larissa. That is your road. You have a great power. That will come out when you are ready to help others."</p>
<p>"But why has Mummy gone?"</p>
<p>"You have to help yourself first. As long as you can't stand on your own feet, you won't be able to help others. It was for that purpose that your mother and father left you."</p>
<p>"...But I can't accept that."</p>
<p>Before Atoa could answer Larissa said again loudly, "Oh, yes! I saw a scene I was talking to Mummy and Daddy!"</p>
<p>Atoa smiled and said, "I'm sure you will meet them again." And she hugged Larissa.</p>
<p>All of the people around the two smiled impressively. At last Larissa got the smile back on her face.</p>
<p>*„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ *</p>
<p>Night came. Larissa, Daniel and Ayako slept restfully. They hadn't slept so well for a long time. The sleep seemed recharging them for the tough tasks they were going to do for many people.</p>
<p>„ÄÄNext morning the three woke up with radiant faces. They now found they didn't need meals, because their bodies felt overflowing with a pleasant force.</p>
<p>They made a trip around the mother-ship because they were too tired to do so the previous day. What they felt was that the nature in the ship didn't look like it was being controlled. They didn't see any machinery or staff for it. It seemed the whole space-ship was one living creature.</p>
<p>The trees had many nuts and fruits on the branches that they had never seen before. And among the trees many kinds of flowers were in bloom. They walked along the brooks, and they seemed to be endless. The three visited Atoa's room last. She welcomed them sincerely.</p>
<p>Larissa asked her, "How is Momotaro?"</p>
<p>"He is recovering quickly. I'm going to meet him as soon as he gets to a higher stage of wave motion."</p>
<p>Ayako replied as Larissa said nothing, "I feel relieved to hear that. But I don't know much about wave motion."</p>
<p>Atoa said, "Everything is made of wave motion. Electrons, protons, all matter, and spirit, thought, soul ? all of these things are made of wave motion. And our force of mind can be resonant with them."</p>
<p>"But ... how can it be resonant?"</p>
<p>"You can't understand by logic. It is important to feel."</p>
<p>"Feel?"</p>
<p>Then Larissa took Ayako's hand. "Let go of your thoughts. Everything resonates. Feel me."</p>
<p>„ÄÄThey stared at each other, and soon Ayako's expression became soft and affectionate. Then Atoa took Ayako's other hand. Her body started to shine and Ayako's, too. Ayako gradually smiled.</p>
<p>"What do you feel?" Atoa asked.</p>
<p>"I feel something warm like love from the highest existence."</p>
<p>"That is your genuine self which has been buried in your soul."</p>
<p>"Oh, it's me! I know that. I'm connected to the highest existence. Everything is resonating!" Ayako replied excitingly.</p>
<p>"Excellent. You'll never go back to your previous self."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Atoa. Thank you, Larissa."</p>
<p>Then Momotaro came into the room with a smile.</p>
<p>"Are you OK?" Larissa went running up to him.</p>
<p>"I have recovered completely," he took her up in his arms, "Thanks for your concern."</p>
<p>"I was really anxious about you," she said with tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>"Sorry, Larissa. But don't worry. I'll never get injured again."</p>
<p>Daniel asked, "Did you get to a higher stage of wave motion?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I did. Some people in a higher stage helped me. And...I've become a new man, so I'm not Momotaro any more. Would you call me Ken from now on?"</p>
<p>"Ken? What is that?"</p>
<p>"It's my real name. I took the name Momotaro, so that people would remember me during the tough times we had recently."</p>
<p>"OK," Larissa replied, "I'll call you Ken." And she added, "I love you, Ken."</p>
<p>All the people there smiled.</p>
<p>Then Daniel said, "I'd like to get to a higher stage, too."</p>
<p>Atoa replied, "There's a special program for you."</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"That's great!"</p>
<p>"But there are some tough subjects in the program."</p>
<p>"Ah...OK." Daniel hung his head a little. "When do I start?"</p>
<p>"From now."</p>
<p>"Now? Oh, God."</p>
<p>Ken said, "You have to want it whole heartedly, otherwise you'll never reach a higher state."</p>
<p>"Yes. I„ÄÄsee."</p>
<p>Then a beautiful lady came in. Atoa looked at her and all of the other people looked, too.</p>
<p>"This is Poppie. Daniel, go with her," Atoa said, "She will lead you to our learning centre."</p>
<p>"OK."</p>
<p>Daniel and the lady went out of the room.</p>
<p>"Sit down, please," Atoa„ÄÄsaid, "I have something to say. All of you have a mission in life. I think by now you know that. And your mission ...."</p>
<p>"I know," Larissa cut in, "We must support people who have awakened to themselves."</p>
<p>"That's right. Very good, Larissa. You are not here together by chance."</p>
<p>Ayako chimed in, "Do you mean the people who have raised their wave motion?"</p>
<p>"Yes." Atoa answered, "There are many people now who have."</p>
<p>"Uh, but how do we do that?"</p>
<p>"I propose that you form a team. Go to the earth and find these people. We'll give you a landing-vehicle."</p>
<p>"How will we find them?"„ÄÄAyako asked.</p>
<p>"Every landing-vehicle has machinery that can detect these particular people."</p>
<p>"Particular people?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Those souls with a high wave motion of love."</p>
<p>"It can sense my wave motion, too?"</p>
<p>"Of course. It states it in figures, but nobody here measures themselves."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"People on the ground compare themselves with others, as a result, they either form a superiority complex or an inferiority complex. It's the cause of competition, friction and war."</p>
<p>"Ah, I see." Ayako replied.</p>
<p>"Taro will pilot the landing-vehicle. Will you treat the injured?"</p>
<p>"No problem, but how...?"</p>
<p>"You can give them first-aid on the earth and then bring them to the well-being centre here. We will teach you how to operate the machinery for injured people. It's not difficult to learn."</p>
<p>"Excellent!"</p>
<p>"OK. Now Larissa, your role is healing their souls. You are the best person for this."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Atoa. I want to be helpful."</p>
<p>Atoa looked at Ken and asked, "Would you support the members of this team?"</p>
<p>"Of course. I'm willing to do it."</p>
<p>"Ah, I have one more thing to add. There are leaders in our world, too. But they are not our superiors. We just cooperate with one another. We are all walking along the same road to the highest goal."</p>
<p>Ayako asked, "Would you tell us what the highest goal is like?"</p>
<p>"It's difficult to say, but if I must express it in words, it is to have the highest wave motion and the highest love."</p>
<p>Then a man in white clothes came in.</p>
<p>"Welcome to our ship," he said with smile.</p>
<p>Atoa replied, "Thank you for coming, Takuya."</p>
<p>"Not at all."</p>
<p>Atoa said to the others, "He'll give you advice. Ask him whenever you have a problem or something you don't understand. He won't go with you to the earth, but you can contact him from anyplace. With him ...," she went on, "make a plan to rescue these souls on the earth."</p>
<p>Takuya said, "OK, everybody?"</p>
<p>Ken answered, "OK, we are ready," and the others nodded.</p>
<p>*„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ*</p>
<p>Daniel's training had started in the well-being centre. He was sitting on a chair and Poppie was standing facing him.</p>
<p>Poppie said, "Your Chakras will be opened by the power waves of the crystal. I'll also emit power waves to you."</p>
<p>"Where is the crystal?"</p>
<p>"It is above your head."</p>
<p>Daniel looked up at the ceiling, and there it was. It was big and it had the shape of two pyramids joined together at their bases. It seemed to float in the air.</p>
<p>The next moment Daniel felt a very gentle light in his head, and he found his brain started to work with a heightened sense of clarity. He felt it was possible to know anything.</p>
<p>The light in his head seemed to go down slowly and stop at his inner forehead. A cubic screen appeared. On it he was living as a Native American several thousand years ago. Surprisingly at that time his wife was Larissa, who was one of the shaman's daughters in the tribe they belonged to.</p>
<p>The screen showed another scene on which he was living in Britain as a Celt. At that time he was a warrior in his tribe and he died in a battle.</p>
<p>He saw many scenes of his past lives on the screen. They changed so quickly but somehow he could memorize them all.</p>
<p>Then the light went down to his heart, and he felt a pleasant warmth around his chest. He thought it was the real love that had been hidden in his inner soul for a long time and now came out of it. Then tears welled up in his eyes for some reason. It seemed a deep emotion ? one he hadn't experienced until now ? that came from realization that he could accept everything from the bottom of his heart.</p>
<p>And then the light went down to the bottom of his stomach. He found himself on the ground in the garden of his original home. Suddenly energy from the earth surged into him. He then understood that the earth was alive and it had cultivated human beings with its love.</p>
<p>He said to himself unconsciously, "Thank you very much, Gaea. I am deeply grateful for all the life you have nurtured."</p>
<p>Poppie kept an eye on Daniel but said nothing.</p>
<p>He went on, "I know that everything on the earth is connected like a latticed net. So nobody is alone. We are all brothers and sisters."</p>
<p>And then his face contorted.</p>
<p>"Many many people ? my brothers and sisters are distressed. I must help. I must go and rescue them!"</p>
<p>"OK, Daniel," Poppie suddenly said and took his hands, "Come back, Daniel!"</p>
<p>she tried to call back his spirit, "Don't worry. We are rescuing them now."</p>
<p>Daniel's spirit came back to his body.</p>
<p>Poppie went on, "You have to make a plan to rescue them with your companions, and join the mission. Your training has finished now."</p>
<p>„ÄÄDaniel opened his eyes and stood up, "Thank you, Poppie."</p>
<p>"They are waiting for you."</p>
<p>"Oh, really?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Let's go back to them."</p>
<p>"OK."</p>

<p>With the members decided and their plan well arranged, they were ready. The team ? Takuya, Taro, Ken, Ayako, Daniel, Larissa - had grown to seven with the last minute addition of Poppie.</p>
<p>Their„ÄÄzone was, of course, Japan. Daniel and Larissa had a few anxieties but it was too late to back out. They left for the earth.</p>
<p>"This is the present situation", Taro said as he pointed a shot of Japan on the screen.</p>
<p>"Oh...," they breathed a sigh but said nothing.</p>
<p>„ÄÄThe Japanese Archipelago they saw was torn into pieces. Their landing-vehicle hovered for a while and then went down to a central part of Japan.</p>
<p>"Can we see Mount Fuji, Taro?" asked Daniel.</p>
<p>"Yes. Give me a second."</p>
<p>He tapped the console. "Here it is."</p>
<p>„ÄÄEveryone's eyes were riveted to the screen.</p>
<p>„ÄÄ"Is that really Mount Fuji?" asked Larissa.</p>
<p>"It sure is. This machine doesn't make mistakes."</p>
<p>„ÄÄMount Fuji was enveloped in smoke that rose from the mountainside with some lines. They couldn't see the summit.</p>
<p>"I wonder if we'll ever see Fuji again in all its glory," Ayako said.</p>
<p>"I can see a clear and beautiful Fuji in the future," Larissa replied.</p>
<p>"I'm glad you can."</p>
<p>Their landing-vehicle moved on and soon reached above a high mountain.</p>
<p>"This is Mount Yarigatake. Many people had gathered here," Taro said and magnified the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>"Oh," Daniel asked surprisingly, "are those bodies?"</p>
<p>"I'm afraid so," answered Taro.</p>
<p>Then Poppie said, "They came from Nagano and Gifu prefectures but they died of starvation and overexposure."</p>
<p>"Where are you going to land?" Ayako asked.</p>
<p>"Uh, I don't know." Taro answered.</p>
<p>"You don't know?"</p>
<p>"Wait! The index has gone up!" Taro said in a low voice and controlled the ship.</p>
<p>Larissa asked Poppie, "What index?"</p>
<p>"The index of love."</p>
<p>"Oh, great! Can it really be measured?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it can. There are some people on the earth who have a higher index than me."</p>
<p>"Than you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, although only a few."</p>
<p>Then Taro told them, "Here."</p>
<p>"OK," Poppie said, "It's very cold outside. Make your body warm."</p>
<p>Ken, Ayako Daniel and Larissa shut their eyes for a moment.</p>
<p>When they opened their eyes, Poppie said, "Let's go."</p>
<p>They all went out of the ship except for Taro. They found an old man who was buried up to his waist in the deep snow.</p>
<p>"Are you OK?" Ken asked and tried to run up to him. But his legs were soon buried, too.</p>
<p>„ÄÄThen Poppie said, "You need to walk on the snow."</p>
<p>"OK, I'll try„ÄÄit."</p>
<p>The next moment he did just that. And the rest followed.</p>
<p>"Hey, answer me," Ken patted the man's cheek.</p>
<p>The face of the man was pale and his eyes were shut. He looked dead.</p>
<p>Poppie said, "Larissa, would you warm his body?"</p>
<p>"Sure." she replied and touched his forehead with her little palm.</p>
<p>"Ken," Poppie went on, "Would you make a Kekkai? We have to stop the wind."</p>
<p>"OK."</p>
<p>When Larissa and Ken had finished their tasks, Poppie said, "Let's surround him. We will lift him out of the snow."</p>
<p>Using the power of their will, their thoughts created a power field in the circle and it started to act on him. His body lifted little by little. Then the landing-vehicle came above him and applied a white light to him. He was lifted and disappeared into it.</p>
<p>"Job well done," Poppie said.</p>
<p>The ship landed by them and the hatch opened.</p>
<p>She said again, "Time to go back."</p>
<p>As soon as they boarded, they left for the mother-ship. When the landing-vehicle reached the mother-ship, they handed over the old man to the well-being staff and left again for the earth.</p>
<p>"I don't think this way is very efficient," Daniel said, "Can't we rescue more people at a time?"</p>
<p>Poppie answered, "It is not our purpose to rescue many people. The people who have real love must be rescued precisely."</p>
<p>"But...I want to rescue more. All of the people are precious. If we make them realize the right way to love, they will begin to walk for it."</p>
<p>"I know how you feel. But nobody has the right to infringe on another's self-direction. This is the way things are."</p>
<p>Daniel fell silent.</p>
<p>Poppie went on, "Everyone is walking their own road. They have to find real love by themselves. All we can do is help them along."</p>
<p>Then Larissa said, "I wonder where the spirits go to after death."</p>
<p>"They will be born on another planet next time," Poppie replied, "In that life they will be put under the same conditions. They will have to repeat the same life unless they overcome the theme they have been given."</p>
<p>"It sounds like school," Ayako said, "They can't graduate unless they pass all their subjects."</p>
<p>"Yes, it's kind of like that. Because every person on the earth was born to undergo ordeals."</p>
<p>Ken said, "The only difference is to graduate early or late. But either way doesn't mean being superior or inferior."</p>
<p>Then Taro told them, "We've got our next assignment! Oh, five people this time. They look like a family. Prepare to leave."</p>
<p>"Where are we going to?" asked Ayako.</p>
<p>"The Northern Okinawa prefecture."</p>
<p>Taro showed the picture, "Look."</p>
<p>Ken pointed to the man in the picture, "I think I've heard of him. He's done many great things but has always kept his name a secret. It has rumoured that he lived in Okinawa."</p>
<p>"I wonder if the others are his family," Daniel said.</p>
<p>"I don't know. But the older two look like a couple and the younger three look like their children."</p>
<p>„ÄÄThey were in a house. The team members could see them with the special telescope.</p>
<p>"We'll land in front of the house," Taro said.</p>
<p>The craft came to rest in the garden and members disembarked. They were very surprised by what they saw. Almost all of the surrounding houses had collapsed. And there was no sign of anyone. The members thought that the survivors had taken refuge somewhere.</p>
<p>„ÄÄKen knocked on the door, "Hello! Are you OK in there?"</p>
<p>Soon an old man came out of the house.</p>
<p>"We have been waiting for you," he said before Ken could greet him.</p>
<p>Poppie said, "We came here in order to invite you to our mother-ship."</p>
<p>"Thank you very much."</p>
<p>Then Larissa asked him, "Why is your body shining?"</p>
<p>"You can see that?"</p>
<p>"I wonder if the others can see it, too."</p>
<p>The old man looked at everyone and said, "I think they all can see it."</p>
<p>"I'm feeling warm," Larissa went on, "It's the first time I've felt such a warm light."</p>
<p>The old man replied, "I can see that you have a cosy light in your soul. It will come out soon and begin shining."</p>
<p>"Thank you ... and may I ask your name?"</p>
<p>"Of course. I'm Hajime Suzuki."</p>
<p>"Oh, ' Hajime' means something new begins."</p>
<p>He smiled, "Rather appropriate for these times, eh?"</p>
<p>Then four people came out of the house and stood behind him.</p>
<p>"This is my family," he said, "My wife and our three children. Would you take them , too?"</p>
<p>"Of course," answered Larissa„ÄÄwith a smile.</p>
<p>Poppie said, "Please enter the landing-vehicle."</p>
<p>"Thank you," they replied.</p>
<p>The rest got in.</p>
<p>As the craft sped upwards, Taro suddenly shouted, "Oh, earthquake!"</p>
<p>They ran up to the windows that were still open and looked down. The house toppled over and broke into pieces.</p>
<p>„ÄÄHajime said, "You were a good house. You have finished your duty."</p>
<p>The landing-vehicle flew back to the mother-ship and dropped the family off. Atoa had come down to meet Hajime.</p>
<p>"Sorry for being late to fetch you," she said.</p>
<p>"No problem," he replied, "I had been busy for a long time and my family has helped me. But after the earth purification started we had a cosy time together."</p>
<p>"I am glad to hear that. Please come with me."</p>
<p>Larissa watched them leave and then asked Poppie, "He has been here before?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but just in spirit."</p>
<p>"I see. He can go anywhere."</p>
<p>The landing-vehicle left for the earth.</p>
<p>Takuya's voice interrupted, "Siberia."</p>
<p>Ken said to himself, "Why Russia?"</p>
<p>Poppie responded, "We have a Japanese there."</p>
<p>"In Siberia?"</p>
<p>"I can hear his voice," Larissa put in, "He's calling us."</p>
<p>"He knows us?" asked Daniel.</p>
<p>"I don't know...but he asked for our help."</p>
<p>"That's the cry of his spirit." Ayako said.</p>
<p>Larissa shouted, "Oh, he's freezing! We have to go quickly."</p>
<p>"We'll reach him soon," Taro replied.</p>
<p>The landing-vehicle came above Siberia and the telescope caught him.</p>
<p>"There!"</p>
<p>„ÄÄThey all watched the screen. A shabby hut stood buried in snow. The next picture showed the inside of the hut. Two people lay by a dying fire in the main room.</p>
<p>"They don't look alive," Ayako said.</p>
<p>"Are you ready?" Taro asked, "It's very cold...minus thirty degrees now."</p>
<p>"OK," Ken replied.</p>
<p>The landing-vehicle dropped off the members. There was a blizzard. They walked above the snow to the hut. Ken knocked on the door. But there was no answer. The lower half of the door was buried in snow.</p>
<p>"We have to remove the snow in front of the door," Ken said.</p>
<p>"How do we do that?" Daniel asked, "We don't have any shovels."</p>
<p>Poppie said, "Move back a little, please."</p>
<p>She held out her hands over the snow. And soon the snow was blown away.„ÄÄKen pulled open the door and entered. It was very dark because the snow covered the windows.</p>
<p>"Are you OK?" he asked.</p>
<p>But there was no answer. They changed to their spiritual eyes to see in the darkness. They found the two people and ran up to them.</p>
<p>Ayako cried, "Oh, no! This one is frozen."</p>
<p>Ken said to the other, "Wake up!"</p>
<p>But he didn't react.</p>
<p>"Will you try to warm him, Larissa?" Ken asked.</p>
<p>"OK."</p>
<p>She did the same as she had done at Mount Yarigatake.„ÄÄHe soon opened his eyes.</p>
<p>"Was it you who heard my voice?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Yes. Don't worry. You are safe now," answered Larissa.</p>
<p>"What are you doing here?" asked Ken.</p>
<p>"Uh, I have known this world would end for some time," he said slowly, "I've heard the cry of Gaea. We've injected poison, extracted petro and cleared the forests."</p>
<p>He coughed.</p>
<p>"OK, take your time."</p>
<p>He continued, "I came to Tura on business. But since I heard the cry, it was hard for me to keep to my work."</p>
<p>"So you came here."</p>
<p>"No, I took some time off to meet my friend in the next city. He had a lodge in a forest. He is a hunter."</p>
<p>"So you met him?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I met him and we left for his lodge. On the way we heard on the car radio that strong earthquakes had occurred all over the world. And then we felt shocks many times, too. We had to stop our car. I knew it was time. And I made up my mind to never return to the city. Because I had committed a grave sin."</p>
<p>"What had you done?"</p>
<p>"I led a team that excavated crude oil and natural gas. We had just found new oil and gas fields. Then I heard the voice of Gaea."</p>
<p>"What did you do after the earthquakes?"</p>
<p>"We continued on our way but we met a blizzard. We resigned ourselves to dying. And then in one direction the blizzard had stopped. We didn't know why. But it was a fact. We got out of the car and walked in that direction. We saw something in the distance and we headed towards it."</p>
<p>"This hut."</p>
<p>"Yes. But there was no firewood, so we couldn't make a fire. If we had burnt the wood from the walls and floor, we would have died soon. We spoke to each other but after a while he became silent."</p>
<p>"Oh," Ken sighed.</p>
<p>Poppie grasped his hand, "I'm sure you were selected. I mean if you didn't decide to quit your job, you wouldn't have been selected."</p>
<p>"But my friend died, even though he loved animals and forests. He believed in the deities of the earth, forests and animals. He always prayed to the deities when he went on a hunt. I learnt the importance of nature from him. It should have been him who has selected."</p>
<p>„ÄÄPoppie replied, "I know, but there is always a reason why someone dies ... hang on."</p>
<p>„ÄÄShe suddenly stopped and looked up. Soon she started to talk.</p>
<p>"He says that he hasn't fulfilled the theme of his life. He was kind to everyone and he did his best for others, but it was not a real love for others. He did it in order to be right himself. He thought it should be done morally, so it was not affection from his sincerity."</p>
<p>"Then, was it his theme to learn the way to love others sincerely?" he asked.</p>
<p>"That's right."</p>
<p>"Where is he going to?"</p>
<p>"He will accept another body again on a planet somewhere else."</p>
<p>Then they heard the voice of Taro, "It's time."</p>
<p>"OK," Ayako answered, "We have to go back."</p>
<p>Ken asked him, "Can you walk?"</p>
<p>"Maybe." He said as he looked at Larissa, "I feel warm now by the grace of the little angel."</p>
<p>Everybody smiled. And then they went out of the hut. The Landing-vehicle was waiting at the front.</p>

<p>CHAPTER ÔºëÔºó„ÄÄ</p>
<p>The Extinction</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>The team Larissa and Daniel belonged to continued to rescue many people. Most of their missions had taken place in Japan, but once in a while they had gone abroad. Larissa and Daniel got used to the job, but they had some questions in their minds.</p>
<p>A few days later the team members were sitting under a tree in the mother-ship.</p>
<p>Daniel asked Poppie, "Why are the people we have to rescue always alive when we get there?"</p>
<p>She answered, "Nobody dies before we get there."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"We all have wave motions. Of course all matter has them. As our wave motions get stronger, and if you have high wave motions in your spirit, your body and the matter around you follows them."</p>
<p>"Then the people we have rescued haven't died as they never thought they would die?"</p>
<p>"That's right. They believe that the things around them will never hurt them."</p>
<p>Larissa asked, "They have always had high regard for the things around them, haven't they?"</p>
<p>"Yes, they have. You have, too, haven't you?"</p>
<p>"Uh, maybe."</p>
<p>„ÄÄDaniel asked, "When is our job going to finish?"</p>
<p>"It won't take much longer."</p>
<p>"And how will the earth turn out?"</p>
<p>"I don't have to say that, because it is best to feel that event with your senses."</p>
<p>Larissa said, "I'm looking forward to the coming of the new age."</p>
<p>"Do you really mean that? Daniel asked.</p>
<p>"Yes. Why?" Larissa replied.</p>
<p>"Because many people are dying now."</p>
<p>"But their spirits live on. Only the body dies."</p>
<p>"Time to go." Poppie„ÄÄcut in, "I've just received the information for our next mission."</p>
<p>They rushed to the landing-vehicle. This time their destination was Otaru in Hokkaido. That city is next to Sapporo where Daniel and Larissa lived with their parents for a short time.</p>
<p>"We passed through Otaru two times," Daniel said.</p>
<p>"I know that," Taro said, "Do you remember Mount Tengu?"</p>
<p>"Er, Tengu is near the centre of Otaru. You get the best view of the town from there."</p>
<p>"Have a look." Taro showed the mountain on the screen.</p>
<p>"Oh, all white!" Larissa shouted excitingly.</p>
<p>The land was covered with a lot of snow.</p>
<p>"It's my first time to see Otaru in winter," she said.</p>
<p>"Where are the people we're going to rescue?" Daniel asked.</p>
<p>"At the foot of the mountain."</p>
<p>Larissa asked, "Where is canal? Where is the rest of Otaru?"</p>
<p>"That's it."</p>
<p>„ÄÄ"Is that Otaru bay? Looks bigger."</p>
<p>"The town sank."</p>
<p>"Oh, God."</p>
<p>"I found the people," Taro told the members, "That is the house."</p>
<p>The next moment a woman with a child appeared on the screen. She was grasping one of the child's hands.</p>
<p>"OK. You can look out of the windows," Taro said.</p>
<p>They made sure of the woman and the child through the windows, and looked down around her house. All of the houses had collapsed except for hers, although the other houses had been newer.</p>
<p>"Two people this time?" Ayako asked.</p>
<p>"No, three," Taro answered.</p>
<p>"So the other one's in the house?"</p>
<p>"Nobody's in there." And Taro added, "Let's go down."</p>
<p>The ship landed in front of the house. The woman and the child stared surprisingly at the ship.</p>
<p>"What....mummy?" the child asked. He understood what his mother said, but he couldn't speak well.</p>
<p>"It looks like a UFO," the mother replied.</p>
<p>Daniel dashed out of the landing-vehicle ahead of the others. As soon as he saw the child, he stopped. The child looked the same age as Daniel. The other members came out and found Daniel staring still at the child.</p>
<p>"Who are you?" Daniel asked.</p>
<p>The child hid behind his mother.</p>
<p>"Talk to me, please."</p>
<p>Then the child asked, "Wha chu?"</p>
<p>"Me? Uh, I'm...." Daniel hesitated to say.</p>
<p>And then the child said, "I'm Daniel. Same's you."</p>
<p>"Yes. I know. We have the same name and ... the same soul."</p>
<p>Everyone looked on in wonder.</p>
<p>"I feel it," Daniel looked up, "He is me."</p>
<p>The child suddenly rushed to Daniel and seized his hand.</p>
<p>"I' bin wait chu."</p>
<p>The child pulled him and tried to run for the landing-vehicle.</p>
<p>"Togethe, let's get'n."</p>
<p>"You wanna go in? OK then."</p>
<p>The two disappeared into the landing-vehicle.</p>
<p>Poppie said to the mother, "We've come to take you and your family."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Where is your husband?"</p>
<p>"He went to the stream to bring water."</p>
<p>"We're going to take you to our mother-ship.</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but ... we aren't in charge of foreigners."</p>
<p>"What are you talking about? Do you mean that you won't take my husband?"</p>
<p>Larissa asked Poppie, "Isn't her husband Japanese?" and she turned to the mother.</p>
<p>"He is Australian," the mother said, "But we are a family."</p>
<p>Then Taro told them, "Come back soon, everyone!"</p>
<p>"What's happening?" Ken asked.</p>
<p>"Earthquake."</p>
<p>"Wait!" the mother cried, "He'll come now!"</p>
<p>"No. We have no time to wait," Ken said.</p>
<p>"I'll stay here until he comes back."</p>
<p>Poppie said to her, "First we must get in the ship."</p>
<p>"No, I won't get in!"</p>
<p>"Oh, God," Poppie said, "Please get in. The earthquake will come soon."</p>
<p>"Can't you go and save my husband first?"</p>
<p>Then her child stood at the entrance of the ship and said, "Mummy, com'plis!"</p>
<p>"Stay here with me, Daniel!"</p>
<p>"No, mummy," he was crying, "I'll go t'dady by thi'ship."</p>
<p>Then the ground started to tremble and the roar of the earth reverberated.</p>
<p>Ken said to the mother, "We won't be able to walk soon."</p>
<p>"What shall I do?" she said, and she called her husband at the top of her voice, "David!"</p>
<p>But there was no answer. Everyone else started to run. As soon as the people got into the landing-vehicle, big sways attacked the ship.</p>
<p>"This is your last chance!" Taro said.</p>
<p>Finally she ran to the ship, too. As she got in, the landing-vehicle leant.</p>
<p>"Oh!" some people raised shouts.</p>
<p>Taro toppled down but he managed to cling to the control panel and push the take off button. The landing-vehicle shot up.</p>
<p>When it got to the height of a thousand metres, Taro said, "have a look!"</p>
<p>The members turned to the screen.</p>
<p>"No, through the windows."</p>
<p>„ÄÄEveryone ran up to them and looked down to the ground.</p>
<p>"Oh, God!" They uttered.</p>
<p>"Is that Mount Tengu?" someone asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, it's leaning!" Daniel said, "Looks as if it's going to sink into the ground!"</p>
<p>Ken said, "The surface is flipping over."</p>
<p>"No!" Larissa cried, "No one will be saved!"</p>
<p>"Just as I thought," the mother said to herself, "The real end has come."</p>
<p>Ayako standing next to the mother replied, "Extinction."</p>
<p>Then Taro shouted, "I found him!"</p>
<p>"Where?" the mother asked.</p>
<p>"He is on a big rock. Look at the screen!"</p>
<p>"Oh," said Ken, "It's a miracle!"</p>
<p>Poppie told them, "Takuya says to rescue him."</p>
<p>The mother said, "I told you before to rescue him."</p>
<p>"Yes, but this is a miracle."</p>
<p>"Let's get him," Taro said.</p>
<p>The landing-vehicle quickly swooped down and stopped above him. Taro lowered a light-tube. David was clinging to the big rock. The light-tube reached him and the next moment his body floated up. All the people held their breath. And soon he appeared on the floor of the ship.</p>
<p>"We did it," said Daniel.</p>
<p>„ÄÄThe mother ran up to him, "Are you OK?</p>
<p>"Yes, but where am I?„ÄÄWas I saved?"</p>
<p>"These people came to rescue us, although I don't know why."</p>
<p>As the landing-vehicle went higher, they could see more through the windows. They found that many mountains were erupting and huge tsunamis were attacking every coast. Everybody gazed at the scenes without words.</p>
<p>After a while Taro shouted, "Look!"</p>
<p>They turned to the screen.</p>
<p>"What is that?" Daniel asked.</p>
<p>"It appeared out of the sea. It looks like a new continent."</p>
<p>"I've heard," the mother said, "that the continents would sink and ones that sank in ancient times would resurface."</p>
<p>"That's possible." Daniel muttered.</p>
<p>Ken asked Taro, "Will you take us to the United States?"</p>
<p>Taro looked back at Ken as if to asked about the reason.</p>
<p>"I heard that the North American continent would sink in the apocalypse." Ken replied.</p>
<p>"OK," he touched the control panel. Soon after he said, "That's funny."</p>
<p>"You can't find it?" Ken asked.</p>
<p>"It's a lot smaller."</p>
<p>They saw big islands on the screen.</p>
<p>Taro said, "Look down through the windows."</p>
<p>"Is that the United States?" Ayako asked.</p>
<p>"Almost all of the North American continent has sunk. It has become an archipelago." Taro answered.</p>
<p>"The whole of Japan may sink." said Ken, "It's smaller."</p>
<p>Everyone was silent. They felt uneasy.</p>
<p>"Shall I make this ship go back to the mother-ship?" Taro asked.</p>
<p>Ayako said in a low voice, "I want to go to Europe as well."</p>
<p>"OK," Taro replied, "then we will go around the earth."</p>
<p>"Thanks." She said.</p>
<p>Soon Taro pointed to the screen again, "Look!"</p>
<p>"What's that?" Ken asked.</p>
<p>"I've never seen it. It may be another new continent."</p>
<p>"Is it the Atlantis continent?" Daniel asked.</p>
<p>"Probably," said Ken.</p>
<p>"Europe has changed, too," Taro said, "See?"</p>
<p>On the screen was another archipelago.</p>
<p>"Everything changed," Ken said, "It no longer looks like the earth."</p>
<p>Poppie explained, "Polluted continents have to sink into the magma to be purified. And continents that sank in ancient times are new appearing as they have been purified. Mankind's destiny is the same as the continents. People with impure souls have to sink and people with purged souls will be brought back to life."</p>
<p>Larissa asked, "How about my mummy and daddy?"</p>
<p>"Sorry, Larissa. I can't give you a straight answer."</p>
<p>Then Taro shouted, "Hey, look out of the windows!"</p>
<p>„ÄÄThey looked down.</p>
<p>"What are they?" Daniel said.</p>
<p>"They look like dragons," Ayako said.</p>
<p>"They aren't dragons," replied Ken, "Although there's no doubt they are reptiles with wings."</p>
<p>"I've read about them," the mother said, "They are evil spirits."</p>
<p>"Evil spirits?" Ayako asked.</p>
<p>"Yes. The book said they have ruled human beings since ancient times."</p>
<p>"I wonder where they are going to." Daniel said.</p>
<p>Poppie replied, "They are going back to their planet. They will never come back to the earth."</p>
<p>Ayako said after a while, "I wonder why they have ruled us."</p>
<p>Poppie explained, "It's about energy. They feed on our dark emotions. They need rage, fear, jealousy, envy and so on to get energy."</p>
<p>Ken said, "I now know why peace never materialized."</p>
<p>"Yes," Poppie replied, "They schemed and plotted to keep humans at war.</p>
<p>"They were the shadow rulers, then?" Daniel asked.</p>
<p>"That's right, although most people were oblivious to that."</p>
<p>Larissa said, "I've known that."</p>
<p>The rest looked at her.</p>
<p>"Too many people were unhappy. Such a situation was unnatural."</p>
<p>"You think people are happy innately?" Daniel asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, I feel so."</p>
<p>Taro said, "I've found something like a small island."</p>
<p>"Where?" asked Ken.</p>
<p>"This islet," Taro said as he watched a monitor on the control panel, "may be what's left Japan....there is a sign of life on it."</p>
<p>"Show us it on the screen, will you?" Ken asked.</p>
<p>"OK, but we have to get closer."</p>
<p>They looked down through the windows.</p>
<p>"There are some people!" Larissa shouted.</p>
<p>"Really?" Daniel pressed his face against a windowpane.</p>
<p>„ÄÄTaro turned to Poppie, "Will you ask Takuya if we can land on the islet?"</p>
<p>She shut her eyes for a moment, and then opened them, "Takuya said our headquarters doesn't have any information about the people."</p>
<p>"I can't believe it." Taro said and asked the members, "What shall we do?"</p>
<p>„ÄÄNobody answered soon and then David replied, "We should land, of course. They may be waiting to be rescued like I was."</p>
<p>"OK," Taro said and asked the members again, "Is everyone in agreement?"</p>
<p>"Yes," all of them replied.</p>
<p>The landing-vehicle came right above the islet.</p>
<p>"Why...?" Ayako said to herself.</p>
<p>Ken said, "They look pretty vigorous."</p>
<p>"Did you see?" Daniel said, "They're not all Japanese."</p>
<p>"Mummy," the child Daniel said, "They'a laufin."</p>
<p>"Yeah, they sure look happy."</p>
<p>"Why hapi?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, but they may have a feeling that the new world will come soon."</p>
<p>On the ground about fifteen people sat in the formation of a ring.</p>
<p>„ÄÄTaro said, "OK, here we go."</p>
<p>„ÄÄSoon the ship landed by the side of the circle. But the people didn't show any surprise. When the members went out of the ship, the people greeted them with smiles on their faces. None of the members knew how to talk to them.</p>
<p>„ÄÄThen one of the people who looked Japanese walked up to Larissa and said, "Welcome to our commune."</p>
<p>„ÄÄHe looked in his sixties but his expression and voice were very youthful.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?" Larissa asked.</p>
<p>"We are dancing and singing in celebration. A new world is coming."</p>
<p>"Don't you feel fear?"</p>
<p>"As we feel pleasure, pleasure comes, because the essence of the universe is pleasure."</p>
<p>"You have overthrown fear, then?"</p>
<p>He laughed and said, "Our wave motion of pleasure keeps everything bad at bay."</p>
<p>„ÄÄThen Poppie said, "You don't look like you need rescuing."</p>
<p>"Rescuing? From what?"</p>
<p>"Now I know why!" Taro said from the ship over the public-address system,</p>
<p>"That's why headquarters hasn't got any data on them."</p>
<p>"OK, that settles it," Poppie replied, "Shall we go back?"</p>
<p>The man said, "Thank you for trying to rescue us."</p>
<p>"No problem," she said.</p>
<p>„ÄÄThen Larissa asked the man, "May I ask you something?"</p>
<p>"Sure, go ahead."</p>
<p>„ÄÄAll the members stared at Larissa.</p>
<p>"May I stay here?"</p>
<p>"Of course, you're allowed to."</p>
<p>Larissa turned to the rest and asked, "Shall we stay here?"</p>
<p>Nobody answered, and Larissa asked, "Poppie, will you ask Takuya if we can stay here?"</p>
<p>"I've asked him. Takuya said you can.</p>
<p>"And the others?"</p>
<p>Poppie turned to the rest, "Anyone who wants to can stay."</p>
<p>„ÄÄKen replied, "I'm going to."</p>
<p>Ayako agreed and Daniel followed suit.</p>
<p>Poppie said, "Taro and I have to take little Daniel and his parents back to the mother-ship."</p>
<p>Ayako asked, "Are you going to come back later, then?"</p>
<p>"Probably."</p>
<p>"OK, see you later," said Daniel.</p>
<p>Poppie boarded the landing-vehicle, which then left for the mother-ship.</p>

<p>CHAPTER ÔºëÔºò„ÄÄ</p>
<p>The New World</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>„ÄÄLarissa, Daniel, Ken and Ayako stayed on the islet. After the landing-vehicle left, the four and the inhabitants of the islet hugged one another. But they didn't exchange any words. They seemed to feel each other's thoughts.</p>
<p>One of the inhabitants who looked in her forties invited the new members to dance. The dance was pretty slow like traditional Japanese dances but sometimes was fast like Russian ones. Larissa and Daniel soon felt intoxicated. Everyone danced for hours but no one felt tired.</p>
<p>Night came. A full moon rose up from the horizon and stars appeared in the sky. Several hours later the bodies of a few people began to shine slightly. And about an hour later Larissa's body started to shine, too.</p>
<p>„ÄÄThen the landing-vehicle came back. The dance stopped. Poppie and Taro came up but they were not alone.</p>
<p>"You look like you've enjoyed the dance," said Takuya who stepped off first.</p>
<p>Larissa answered, "Yes, we've enjoyed it very much. Are you going to stay here?"</p>
<p>"I'd like to." He turned to the inhabitants and asked, "Is there room for us, too?"</p>
<p>„ÄÄOne of the old men stepped forward and replied, "This islet doesn't belong to anyone. We are just borrowing it from the Universe."</p>
<p>"OK. Shall we greet the new world?"</p>
<p>"Of course."</p>
<p>Then suddenly the moon faded out. They looked up at the sky, and all of the stars flew and disappeared. The next moment jet-black darkness covered the islet. But some people's bodies including Larissa's were shining slightly.</p>
<p>„ÄÄThey looked like they were praying something in their mind but there were no uneasy expressions on their faces, only peaceful ones.</p>
<p>„ÄÄThey heard a roar under the sea next and soon the surface of the sea started rising higher and higher. But strangely the huge waves didn't reach the islet. Around the islet the sea kept rippling. In a distance many huge pillars of fire rose here and there. Light from them reflected off their faces.</p>
<p>„ÄÄOne of the inhabitants started dancing. His body was shining a little. The rest stared at him in the beginning, but one by one they joined him and made a circle. After all of them had joined the dance, their bodies gave off a great deal of white light.</p>
<p>„ÄÄLarissa and Daniel then noticed that all of the people had large wings on their backs like angels. The two looked at each other's wings and then turned back to see their own. They tried to touch them but it was difficult. They tried to spread their wings, and it was easy to do. So they flapped. The next moment their bodies floated a little in the air.</p>
<p>"Daniel, we can fly." Larissa tried to say, but before she could, the answer came back from Daniel.</p>
<p>'Yes, we can!'</p>
<p>„ÄÄHis words came to her brain directly without voice. She wondered at that, and soon Daniel's words came again.</p>
<p>'I thought it was strange, too. But there's no denying it.'</p>
<p>„ÄÄLarissa replied, 'We can talk in our hearts'</p>
<p>Then all of the people came up to them. Larissa and Daniel felt all of them were full of delight. They turned around to see the islet but they couldn't see it anywhere.</p>
<p>'Look! A large continent has appeared,' Takuya said in his heart, and soon that was understood by all of them.</p>
<p>„ÄÄThey could see many rushing rivers which looked like they were discharging seawater. They could see many erupting volcanoes which looked like they were drying the earth. Hand in hand they formed a new circle. The circle started to spin and it headed to the continent.</p>
<p>„ÄÄAyako said, 'It seems everything I think is being transmitted.'</p>
<p>'We can't keep any secrets,' a woman said.</p>
<p>'That means we can't tell a lie,' Daniel said.</p>
<p>„ÄÄThey reached the continent but they didn't land because there were no plants, no animals, no soil only rocks.</p>
<p>„ÄÄPoppie said, 'It seems time is passing very quickly. Look!'</p>
<p>„ÄÄAll of them stared at the ground, and the rivers dried up and the volcanoes calmed down one after another. Surprisingly the surface of the earth was turning green.</p>
<p>'It's almost as if several million years have passed in an instant!' Daniel cried in his heart.</p>
<p>'It must be right,' replied Ken, 'Trees are growing and birds are flying!'</p>
<p>'Let's go up higher,' Takuya said, 'We can watch the globe changing.'</p>
<p>„ÄÄThey got to a higher altitude and went around the earth. No wind hit them.</p>
<p>'Only one continent has appeared,' Daniel said, 'And the seawater is muddy.'</p>
<p>Larissa told him, 'The core of the earth is now purified and I saw the seawater getting clearer.'</p>
<p>'Yes, we feel that, too.' It was Takuya and Poppie's reply.</p>
<p>'Oh, I forgot that my thoughts are quickly transmitted to everyone.' Larissa said and smiled. And the rest laughed all together.</p>
<p>Ayako said soon, 'Look down at the sea. It's just as Larissa said.'</p>
<p>„ÄÄThey saw that a part of the clean sea was spreading over the whole globe.</p>
<p>'Do you notice,' Ken said, 'how the mountains on the continent are getting flat, and the currents of the rivers are getting gentle?'</p>
<p>'It looks like our planet is becoming beautiful,' Takuya said, 'There are no poisons, no pollution and no people who will hurt the earth. Well, let's go down.'</p>
<p>„ÄÄThe circle formed by them fell down near the surface.</p>
<p>'Oh, the speed of time has returned to normal,' Daniel said, 'Those whales are swimming slowly.'</p>
<p>'Yes!' Larissa replied, 'We can land.'</p>
<p>They approached the continent and went down. On the earth there were no mountains and in the sky there were no clouds. They landed at a point on a broad plain by a river. They let go each other's hands and looked around. Then everything on the earth ? trees, grass, leaves, rivers, rocks, soil and even the air started shining.</p>
<p>'Wow!' all of them gave a shout of delight.</p>
<p>'This is the new world, isn't it?' Larissa asked.</p>
<p>'Yes, it is,' Poppie answered, 'From now on we won't have war, quarrels or disputes.'</p>
<p>„ÄÄTakuya added, 'In this new world there're no illnesses or aging.'</p>
<p>'Great!' Daniel shouted.</p>
<p>„ÄÄThen their mother-ship appeared above them and many landing-vehicles came rushing out of it. Soon some ships landed nearby them and people came out of the ships.</p>
<p>'Welcome to the new continent,' Takuya said, 'Here is Mother Earth.'</p>
<p>'Marvellous!' a middle aged woman said and hugged him.</p>
<p>The members of Larissa's group hugged the new arrivals one by one. After that, all of them looked around again with great interest. Some of them went into a forest and some of them went to a river.</p>
<p>„ÄÄLarissa and Daniel went to a river where several people were bathing.</p>
<p>„ÄÄ The two cautiously walked up into the water to their knees.</p>
<p>'Oh, this water is shining!' Daniel said.</p>
<p>'The pebbles on the bottom are shining, too!' Larissa replied.</p>
<p>'Fish! They look like tropical ones!'</p>
<p>'Oh, how beautiful!</p>
<p>'They came up to us.'</p>
<p>'I'm sure they want to exchange greetings.'</p>
<p>'Really?'</p>
<p>'You have to reply.' Larissa said and put her hand into the water.</p>
<p>„ÄÄ Soon the fish crowded around her hand and began nibbling at it. Daniel gazed at what was happening before him.</p>
<p>Larissa chuckled and said, 'Nice to meet you.'</p>
<p>Surprisingly Daniel felt the fish saying back to her 'Nice to meet you, too.'</p>
<p>Daniel did the same as her, and the fish nibbled at his hand, too.</p>
<p>Then the two heard the twitter of birds above them. They looked up, and small birds flew down on their shoulders.</p>
<p>'Nice to meet you,' the two greeted the birds and the birds replied.</p>
<p>'I've just realised!' Daniel said, 'Everything has welcomed us. All of the creatures want to greet us.'</p>
<p>'That's right! We must reply to all of the creatures!'</p>
<p>The two walked out of the river and started to run into a forest. Daniel hugged the trees one by one and Larissa talked to the grass and flowers.</p>
<p>'You all love us. I love you, too. I love you, too.'</p>
<p>„ÄÄAfter a while Larissa came across Ayako. She was accompanied by five animals. One of them looked like a deer, another one looked like a pony and the other three looked like foxes.</p>
<p>'Did you notice?' Ayako asked, 'None of the animals turn against each other.'</p>
<p>'Yeah? I guess there're not carnivorous.' she said as she patted the pony.</p>
<p>„ÄÄSeveral hours later Takuya called the people around him for meeting.</p>
<p>'I think we shall make a colony,' he said.</p>
<p>'Oh, good,' all the people replied.</p>
<p>'But in order to live with nature, it shouldn't be a city but a town, although all of you already knew that.'</p>
<p>„ÄÄOne of the people said, 'I wonder if we can use technology again.'</p>
<p>'We will, but not just for humans. We have to use it in accordance with the laws of nature.'</p>
<p>„ÄÄDaniel asked, 'Can we use the trees in the forest?'</p>
<p>'Of course. If you are thankful to a tree, the tree would be glad to be used.'</p>
<p>„ÄÄThen another person said, 'That's good. We also have to make fields.'</p>
<p>'OK, but you don't need to eat anything from now on, although if you want to enjoy eating and drinking, it's possible.'</p>
<p>They asked Takuya about many other things. He told them that they could make alcohol and tobacco. They wouldn't need to go to the toilet. Soon their wings would come off their bodies but they would be able to fly without them. They could expect to live 10 times longer than they would have in the old world. There wouldn't be frontiers. There wouldn't be rulers or classes but all of the people would have their own roles...and so on.</p>
<p>*„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ*</p>
<p>On the enormous continent people started to reclaim land here and there. They made tools of stones first and built some huts next, during that time they slept under trees on the grass but the insects, worms and animals didn't disturb their sleep.</p>
<p>After several months they built some lodges where they made many kinds of instruments for the reclamation. And after more than a year they built a large circular house in the centre of their colony. In the round court inside the house they sometimes had meetings.</p>
<p>They made fields to grow agricultural products and made a blast furnace to forge iron tools. They also made looms for cloth and a kiln for pottery.</p>
<p>The reason why they could make those things was there were many experienced people. If nobody knew the way to make something, they asked a person in one of the nearby colonies.</p>
<p>After three more years their lives became cosy. It rained when the plants and fields needed it. A gentle breeze always blew. And there were no storms, no snow, no thunder or lightning.</p>
<p>After ten more years the people in the new world decided to use technology. But they followed the laws of nature. They didn't try to use it to conquer nature, but instead to utilize nature.</p>
<p>„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄÔºä</p>
<p>One day Taro and Larissa came across one another by a river. They hadn't seen each other for several months, so they both had wanted to meet very much. They each looked a little older but still young, because the human life span had increased so much.</p>
<p>'Hi, Larissa. How are you getting along?'</p>
<p>'Hi, Taro. I'm learning the way to dye cloth.'</p>
<p>'Oh, good. I'd like to see the cloth you have dyed'.</p>
<p>'I need a little more time until I can do it by myself.'</p>
<p>'OK.'</p>
<p>'Er, I'd like to give you my first work. Would you accept it?'</p>
<p>'Of course. I'm looking forward to the day.'</p>
<p>'And...shall we take a walk?'</p>
<p>'Yes. I was thinking the same.'</p>
<p>The two smiled at the same time and walked along the river for a while. The sun was shining softly and a breeze blew gently. In the sky small birds were singing and on the surface of the river fish jumped.</p>
<p>'You're about twenty...something?' Taro asked.</p>
<p>'My age?'</p>
<p>'Yes.'</p>
<p>'How long have you lived? Larissa asked back.</p>
<p>'Ur, in fact, I'm a hundred and fifty three.'</p>
<p>Suddenly Larissa laughed, 'That's about six times as old as me.'</p>
<p>'So...it's impossible,' Taro said to himself.</p>
<p>'What?'</p>
<p>'Uh....' Taro hesitated to say something.</p>
<p>'What on earth is the matter?'</p>
<p>'Just a moment.'</p>
<p>Larissa laughed again and said, 'You're not quite yourself today.'</p>
<p>'Yes, that's true.'</p>
<p>'Well?'</p>
<p>One moment later Taro said, 'Would you marry me some day?'</p>
<p>Larissa became stiff. For a while she didn't show any reaction. Taro kept still and waited for her to answer.</p>
<p>'Why some day?'</p>
<p>'Because you are still young and...I thought it was sudden.'</p>
<p>'I can't wait.'</p>
<p>'What do you mean?'</p>
<p>'I love you. Let's not wait.'</p>
<p>'That's great!'</p>
<p>Larissa felt a warm wave motion from him.</p>
<p>'If you made me wait, I would not have said yes.'</p>
<p>'I wouldn't have expected you to.'</p>
<p>Then many birds each with a flower in their beak came to fly above the two and let go of the flowers.</p>
<p>The two looked up and said, 'Thank you very much.'</p>
<p>In the river some hundred fish jumped at once in a half circle.</p>
<p>'Thank you very much,' the two said again.</p>
<p>Just then many people appeared from the woods. They had some flowers in their hands. They walked up the two and gave the flowers.</p>
<p>'Congratulations,' the people said gently.</p>
<p>'Thank you, everybody,' the two replied.</p>
<p>All of them were filled with joy. It was as if they were all brothers and sisters. In the new world there were no ceremonies or formalities, so they became a couple there and then. They didn't need a wedding ring or a vow. It was enough to have love and confidence.</p>
<p>*„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ*</p>
<p>Several days later a very delightful thing happened.</p>
<p>Atoa visited the colony from the sky. This was one stop on a visit to all of the colonies. She was accompanied by some people. The residents of the colony gathered in the courtyard.</p>
<p>Suddenly Larissa cried out at the top of her voice, "Mummy! Daddy!"</p>
<p>She started running and Daniel followed. One after another they embraced each other until Daniel asked, "What has brought you here?"</p>
<p>And asked Larissa, "How were you brought back to life?"</p>
<p>Their parents smiled at them and soon Father answered, "We have been cleansing our spirits in another dimension."</p>
<p>"All this time?" Daniel asked.</p>
<p>"Yes. In this world it's a long time but in that dimension it's like for ever."</p>
<p>Mother said, "We could come to this new world as we had finished our time there."</p>
<p>"What kind of things did you do?" Daniel asked.</p>
<p>"Renouncing all of desires," Father answered, "mastering fortitude, understanding what love is, and the like."</p>
<p>"You can live here from now on, can't you?" asked Larissa.</p>
<p>"Of course," Mother answered, "for ever."</p>
<p>All around the colony there were raised shouts of joy. Some of the people met their parents, sons and daughters, grandpas and grandmas or friends again. Even those who did not reunite with loved ones were filled with joy.</p>
<p>*„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ*</p>
<p>In the new world people didn't have more than three children. They didn't build cities, apart from one which served as the capital and that was not so large. And they didn't make the colonies larger.</p>
<p>It was not so long before they made space ships. Beings from other planets taught them many things about science and spirits.</p>
<p>The people loved one another and loved the flowers, trees, animals, fish and all of the creatures in the new world.</p>
<p>The earth was shining in blue and the people lived in peace for ever.</p>
