<p>In order to enhance the sensitivity of sound, it is necessary to listen to music a number of times and cultivate ears. If the sensitivity of the ears increases, perfect copying of ear copies and vocals becomes possible. Now there are sound quality problems even on Youtube and so on but if the sensitivity is good it is possible to make ear copies so it is to listen and listen to the image many times in the head. If you can make ear copies, you can make use of songs, and the quality will also be high. As ear copying becomes possible, it becomes possible to mass produce many songs, and you can also develop from it to make original songs. Anyway, I hear it many times and it is exhausted to this. When the sensibility of the ears feeds, the vocals can also cover, and by repeatedly practicing many times, it is possible to make songs with higher quality in a few years. However, it is not interesting with the same thing of ear cops, so it is also important to create originality there. I am adding drum originality. This is the drum of Pawor of paradice.</p>

<p>As I can tell by listening to iTunes and Amazon, I have included a lot of hi-hat, snare, cymbal and so on.</p>
<p>It is to put originality somewhere if you feel it is incomplete at all. I think that there are many people who do not know even if you look at the screen, but the part that is a point is MIDI</p>
1drum you can use the Studio drum with the sound structure free.<p>You can use the battery (Native instruments) Disco Neu Kid or Connect kid. It is a pretty usable sound source. I do not know if it has been updated now but I love this. However, depending on the material, it will be a cracked sound, so be careful.</p>

<p>In that case, there are hands to see all notes, notes divided from event division and using a single note. Even if I copy it "even if I do not have the tone, the songs are messed up.Selecting the tone is a matter of sense.If you are a raw</p>

<p>I think that there is a problem of preference, but I would be pleased if you could use it as a reference for choosing a tone color.</p>

<p>Recently I have used Yamaha because krypton is expensive. I make music using score and sample etc. to memorize chord progression etc in ear copi. However, I think that lyrics and composers do not have to stick to the tub so much. It is important to listen to various songs and to develop melody sense, as Sakurai Kazuyoshi and Hyde will record only vocals and submit them and talks will make lyrics and compositions. Lyrics are attached to the melody. People who can not make lyrics can not make melodies. There is also a method called Instrument, but I feel something somewhat unsatisfactory. If you can do lyrics, you can ask for temporary singers or sing your own songs and submit them so you need to study melody sense. My ear copy was not very good one year ago. Honestly. But recently the level has risen and it has become possible to publicly announce even in public. From the age of 5, "Ear copying studies took time to start, as I started an electro-kicking," it took me a while to talk back but I am using W comp 's H comp to punch the drums. This is quite a punchy drum. By selecting Panding drum from Load and raising ANALOG to about 3 and raising OUTPUT to about 10</p>
<p>It is to give out a sound. It does not make sense if you do not hear the sound even if you copy it. "The tone is to mix to a degree that does not disturb the vocal well by mixing.</p>

Let's apply the comp for recording of vocals and record. I compare Waves's C1 comp<br />
<img src="images/000006.jpg" />
<p>or Pro compressor</p>

<p>I'm recording it over. It is useful because it will be recorded cleanly. Even if you copy ear, let's record firmly as vocals are cracked or poor recording quality is a waste. It was something to be helpful for composing songs with higher ear sensitivity and more sensitivity. Thank you.</p>
