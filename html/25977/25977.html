<p>You are a very kind person</p>
<p>And you are a very strong person</p>
<p>You are a person who understands the hearts of people very much</p>
<p>But that makes you depressed and lack of sleep</p>
<p>I sincerely pray that this book will improve your life</p>
<hr />
<p>You always strive to meet the expectations of the surroundings</p>
<p>You tried to meet the expectations of your favorite parents when you were a child</p>
<p>But surrounding parents did not thank you for your effort</p>
<p>That caused you to feel depression and lack of sleep</p>
<hr />
<p>It is because you did not feel depressed or sleep depended on your effort</p>
<p>Especially your surroundings and your parents were indifferent to your effort</p>
<p>Your surroundings and your parents did not accept your heart and soul</p>
<p>Your surroundings and your parents pushed the ego against you</p>
<p>Strong and gentle You took the ego whole body</p>
<p>However, none of them admitted you</p>
<p>Eventually the surroundings and parents' ego began to eat your heart and soul eventually</p>
<p>And you got depression and sleep deprivation</p>
<hr />
<p>Do you know what triggered the cause of depression or lack of sleep?</p>
<p>I will ask you a question</p>
<p>Are you passive type?<br />
Or is it a spontaneous type?</p>
<p>People who are liable to depression or lack of sleep are almost passive types Your surroundings and your parents are seeing that So your surroundings and your parents will push your ego to you You tried to respond to ego with full power And you and your heart and soul are exhausted</p>
<hr />
<p>But your surroundings and your parents did not really respond to your effort</p>
<p>It is because you are depressed or lack of sleep</p>
<hr />
<p>You must understand that you become depressed or sleep deprived when you become passive</p>
<p>Passive is that it is dependent</p>
<p>There is a good meaning and a bad meaning in dependence</p>
<p>It is good dependence for people to cooperate for each other's development</p>
<p>It is a bad dependence to impose weakness on people</p>
<p>Dependence is born in nature</p>
<p>Nobody can blame others with dependence Also, no one has the right to judge a person with dependence</p>
<hr />
<p>There are two reasons why your surroundings and your parents made you depression or lack of sleep</p>
<p>The first is desperate bad compatibility between you and your surroundings and parents</p>
<p>Next around you and your parents were very immature</p>
<p>And because you are a dependent constitution in a bad meaning</p>
<p>But I will never blame people with dependence</p>
<p>Dependence is inherent</p>
<p>Nobody can blame the dependence constitution</p>
<p>But, if you are depressed or lack of sleep you must change dependence Because the dependence is passive and we take the human ego at full power</p>
<hr />
<p>Everything is a duty to passive life</p>
<p>Life is also duty<br />
Even duty to eat<br />
Conversation is also duty<br />
It is also obligatory to watch TV<br />
It is also obligation to sing<br />
Dance is also obligatory<br />
Work also duty<br />
And sleeping is also obligatory</p>
<p>You are not yourself in duty</p>
<p>You can not sleep because you do not have yourself</p>
<p>You can not sleep because it is dependent on sleep</p>
<hr />
<p>It is because you can not rest assured that you can not sleep depends on someone</p>
<p>People take sleep to rest.<br />
But people with insufficient sleep try to sleep for someone However, someone who does not appreciate your efforts You have to take a rest for you</p>
<hr />
<p>People who are not sleeping have received a lot of love from their parents when they were children</p>
<p>They were given peace of mind from their parents when they went to bed. In other words, they were very fun to go to bed. And they had their efforts acknowledged from surrounding parents and parents</p>
<p>People who were not sleep insisted earned rewards for their efforts because they recognized their hearts and souls from their surroundings and their parents</p>
<p>The reward of sleeping is rest and restoration</p>
<p>You must think of sleep as a means of rewarding Sleeping reward is rest and restoration</p>
<hr />
<p>But if you take a sleep for someone you depend on, you will lack sleep</p>
<p>And that someone will not thank you for your efforts</p>
<p>You have to take a sleep for you<br />
Sleeping reward is rest and restoration But if you are a dependent constitution it will be difficult to get a sleep Because you are sleeping for someone</p>
<hr />
<p>I will introduce the technique for sleeping on you who can not sleep easily</p>
<p>You must first know the reward of sleeping</p>
<p>Sleeping reward is rest and restoration is not it?</p>
<p>So, when you spend the day think like this "I will live my best today to get a good sleep."</p>
<p>Please spend the whole day to have a good sleep Is it OK? I spend my whole day to sleep better</p>
<p>The reward of spending the whole day is to get a good sleep Please burn this word in the head.</p>
<p>You spend the day to the best of your good sleep</p>
<hr />
<p>People do not get tired when they work hard all day for sleep</p>
<p>Please think like this in a day and a tough time "I have this hard time for a good sleep,"</p>
<p>During commuting<br />
Even while studying<br />
Also during work<br />
Even when my boss is saying a little word Let's not forget that people do their best to get a good sleep</p>
<p>When you feel painful when you are in a difficult situation, you think about painful things when you go to bed As a result you get lack of sleep</p>
<hr />
<p>Let's close our eyes when we enter the bed Let's think about this "I worked hard in today to get a good sleep from now." And<br />
"I am going to sleep now is to get a good night's sleep, good sleep brings rewards for rest and recovery" Finally<br />
"I will take a sleep to spend the whole day to the fullest"</p>
<p>You have to deceive your brain<br />
"Oh ... this owner of the body wants to get a good sleep ..." "Oh god ... Does this flesh owner sleep for tomorrow for now? Well I was thinking about sleeping all day long."</p>
<hr />
<p>The important thing about this story is the place to connect the past, the present and the future autonomously</p>
<p>If you theorize the past, the present and the future for rewards, your brain will make you feel asleep as you say "OK, I understood"</p>
<p>As you continue thinking about hardships, your brain says, "Well so, the owner of this body wants to continue thinking about hardships" that many of the painful things of the past are arranged side by side to you Learn more</p>
<p>People who go to bed soon are planted with rewards for sleeping unconsciously to their surroundings and parents as a child</p>
<p>They instinctively understand the tips of sleeping</p>
<p>You only have to work hard all day to get some sleep for you</p>
<hr />
<p>I ask you a question.</p>
<p>Do you have an ego?</p>
<p>Are you still passive with you having an ego?</p>
<p>Do you still have passion and dependence while having an ego?</p>
<p>Your surroundings and your parents did not admit your heart and soul to you?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if you have all of the above, you are very likely to be depressed</p>
<hr />
<p>Ego, dependence, passion and lack of love make you depressed</p>
<p>The superficial problem is immature in parents and your native constitution</p>
<p>But this is also possible, that your parents and surroundings could have been raised like you, that your parents and their surroundings were only obliged to live, and you That things may be able to break negative chains</p>
<hr />
<p>You will be depressed when you can not live like you</p>
<p>What do you mean by yourself?</p>
<p>Yourself is your soul</p>
<p>The soul is the real reason you were born</p>
<p>The real reason you were born is your mission in the world</p>
<p>But it is very difficult for you to notice your mission</p>
<hr />
<p>You need to use astrology to notice your mission</p>
<p>Your constellation has a mission</p>
<p>Constellation is your role</p>
<p>If you do not notice your role you will wander for the rest of your life</p>
<p>Constellation is the mission God has given you</p>
<p>God uses the constellation to give you a role</p>
<hr />
<p>But your surroundings and your parents ignored your constellation</p>
<p>You have been deprived of the role in this world</p>
<p>So you lost yourself</p>
<p>You can only live for someone</p>
<p>Soon you became depressed</p>
<p>Because people and God are connected and it makes sense for people to live by performing given roles</p>
<p>You were deprived of your life<br />
That's why you got depressed or sleep deprived</p>
<hr />
<p>You lose yourself, desperately trying to save someone to help you</p>
<p>But the surroundings could not save you There is no choice but to save you to save you</p>
<p>You were pure innocence, you did not know anything Pure and innocent You took up the power of your surroundings and your parents with full power and eventually lost your heart and soul</p>
<hr />
<p>Do you understand why the surroundings are pressing you to the ego?</p>
<p>Actually, you were unconsciously pressing the ego around you So the surroundings had been forced on you by ego</p>
<p>You were unconsciously pressing the lack of love around you So the surroundings did not satisfy the feeling of lack of your love</p>
<p>You rely on surroundings with hostility So the surroundings turned malicious toward you</p>
<p>In order for you to get out of the negative chain you must first stand on your own from the surroundings You can do it.</p>
<hr />
<p>Next, you must give love to your surroundings Love is to recognize heart and soul</p>
<hr />
<p>In the end you have to connect with God God is your mission</p>
<p>People can connect with God when they are fulfilling their mission</p>
<p>Mission is your constellation or star</p>
<p>But if you impose malice, lack of depression, dependence around you, it will bounce back to you exactly as it is So you have to be independent from around</p>
<hr />
<p>Your fear and hostility are rebounding on you when you are in a paranoia due to the symptoms of depression</p>
<p>You are attracting dependence and malice by yourself Is it OK? You are all attracting your inner self yourself</p>
<p>You must be independent.<br />
You must change your hostility to love<br />
Love is to recognize the heart and soul</p>
<hr />
<p>Believe in God</p>
<p>God is your mission</p>
<p>Mission is your constellation</p>
<p>Constellation is your role in this world of you</p>
<hr />
<p>You must understand surroundings and your parents</p>
<p>Your surroundings and your parents are probably those who lived for someone else, they did not live for themselves They did not recognize heart and soul<br />
So they did not have opponents to press egos on you only They could not give love from their surroundings and parents So they did not give love to you</p>
<p>You are kind hearted person, you are a very strong person, That is why you were born under them</p>
<hr />
<p>Your mission is to cut off their negative chains</p>
<p>The state of depression will continue as long as you do not fulfill your mission</p>
<p>A person can only be saved by saving a person</p>
<p>It is by no means living for someone<br />
That will make you live for you</p>
<p>Life is connected<br />
That is why you have to break a negative chain</p>
<hr />
<p>Depression is a common succession</p>
<p>Sleep shortage is also unfortunately inherited</p>
<p>But negative chains can be broken without fail You can do it.<br />
Because it is your mission<br />
Believe in God, God is your mission</p>
<hr />
<p>Mission is to break negative chains first</p>
<hr />
<p>The next mission is to understand surroundings and parents Understanding is love, love is to recognize the heart and soul of a person</p>
<hr />
<p>As you fulfill your mission, you will become independent</p>
<p>And finally play the role in this world</p>
<hr />
<p>If you do not fulfill your mission and have dependence on people, you will have sleep deprivation and depression, human beings are made in that way</p>
<p>Bad dependence is to impose a negative chain on opponents And bad dependence is to live a life for someone who is never grateful</p>
<p>If you live for someone you do not appreciate, you will lack sleep</p>
<p>But you can cut off the inherited negative chain</p>
<hr />
<p>you are a kind person</p>
<p>You are a very strong person</p>
<p>That is why God gave you a role</p>
<p>You will begin to live a real life when you work independent and role</p>
<p>Do you not start with things that do not depend on me of the author of this book first?</p>
